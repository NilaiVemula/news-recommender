# Models

This directory is a place to store all models for this project. Currently, there are two models:
- pre-trained Google News word2vec model 
- XGBoost binary classifier

The Google News model is not included in this git repository due to its large file size, but it can be found [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).
