representation at red bull but that the leadership wasn’t interested business insider have you ever heard of the phrase “get woke go broke” it turns out there is a simple way to prevent this and it

to have a new administration there was plenty to question about the previous one’ he said referring to the obama administration raging at ‘political correctness’ and the ‘intellectual elite’ mateschitz was also highly critical of germany and austria for opening their doors at the height of the 2015 refugee crisis taking aim at those who encouraged refugees or used angela merkel’s slogan of ‘we’ll manage it’ he said that none of those people ‘made their guest rooms available for five migrants to live in’ daily mail long live dietrich mateschitz related black lives matter is an

tracks",https://news.yahoo.com/crenshaw-despite-being-outspent-texas-135533637.html,Havvocck2,1509,309,national review lew wallace the former territorial governor of new mexico and author of ben hur once said “every calculation based on experience elsewhere fails in new mexico”in so many ways wallace was prescient about this beautiful poor and unique state in the american southwest one “calculation” about modern politics that would especially perplex him is the fact that a relatively poor but oilrich western state elects politicians that are so directly at odds with its economic best interestafter texas and north dakota new mexico is the thirdlargest oilproducing state in the us the oil and gas industries combine to generate roughly 40 percent of its annual budget furthermore new mexico’s oil and gas resources are heavily concentrated on lands managed by the federal government the central role of energy especially energy extracted within the state’s borders and controlled by federal policymakers might lead one to believe that new mexicans would vote for proenergy republicans in federal electionsinstead new mexico has become a safely blue state it narrowly went for george w bush in 2004 but since then has gone for democrats by wide margins the situation is even more stark at the state level where democrats have had “trifectas” total control of both houses and the governor’s mansion for 60 of the past 90 years the gop hasn’t had such governing authority in the state for a single year since 1931 and despite significant turnover has not elected a republican to the us senate since pete domenici retired in 2009in 2020 biden won the state 543 percent to 435 percent despite the fact that president trump’s proenergy policies have been a boon to the new mexico economy and that the biden administration’s energy policies are a dagger aimed at the heart of new mexico’s economythat “dagger” comes in the form of the numerous sometimes clear often conflicting statements that candidate biden made during the campaign it is unclear what biden will do about hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” which enables oil and gas producers to access previously inaccessible oil and gas sources he backed away from an outright nationwide ban late in the campaign however biden has clearly stated that he would ban new gas and oil permits including fracking on federal landstargeting federal lands would devastate new mexico’s oil and gas industry and its economy because of the state’s large federal estate according to the institute for energy research 347 percent of the land in new mexico is federal in fiscal year 2019 new mexico received energyrelated disbursement from the federal bureau of land management of 117 billion the highest payment made in any state wyoming was next with 641 million and then colorado with 108 million this was the highest payment from the bureau in the state’s history and compares with 455 million in fy 2017 a vast majority of this increased revenue is a result of frackingfurthermore data from the global energy institute indicate that if energy production on federal lands were banned new mexico would lose 24300 jobs 10000 direct 14300 indirect and induced a significant hit for a state with a workforce of around 900000 making matters worse a good number of the “direct” jobs lost are goodpaying something that is not easy to find in new mexico a state that consistently ranks among the poorest in the nation and has been hardhit by the covid19 pandemic closing new mexico’s federal lands to energy production entirely would cost the state 496 million in annual royalty collections representing 8 percent of the state’s total general fund revenuesbiden’s proposed fracking ban is even too much for new mexico’s democratic governor michelle lujan grisham who has said that she’ll ask for an exemption from any future drilling ban acknowledging the taxrevenue contributions to education funding grisham explained to the new mexico oil and gas association conference in santa fe last october that “without the energy effort in this state no one gets to make education the top priority”to be sure lujan grisham is broadly supportive of biden’s energy policies she’s even on the presidentelect’s short list for administration positions both of them have stated that they would like to “transition out of fossil fuels” despite new mexico’s financial dependence on the industrybut biden’s aggressive antifossilfuels stance as it relates to federal land not only puts him at odds with lujan grisham it puts him far to the left of president obama on the issue in a 2012 presidential debate obama stated “we’ve opened up public lands we’re actually drilling more on public lands than the previous administration and natural gas isn’t just appearing magically we’re encouraging it and working with the industry”president obama was of course considered an environmentalist by political opponents and supporters alike his support for naturalgas right isn’t difficult to reconcile with his environmental track record that’s because when used in a new power plants natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less co2 than a typical new coal plantobama understood the vast benefits of natural gas including the fact that it was appropriate to drill for it on federal lands during his tenure naturalgas production rose some 35 percent from approximately 21 million cubic feet to more than 284 million cubic feetif he truly cares about the environment biden would be wise to follow his predecessor’s playbook according to the epa us net greenhousegas emissions went down by 10 percent from 2005 to 2018 and much of the contribution to that decline in recent years was “due to an increasing shift to use of less carbon dioxideintensive natural gas for generating electricity and a rapid increase in the use of renewable energy in the electric power sector” but if naturalgas prices rise and a ban on federal leasing is likely to contribute to higher prices these positive developments could go into reverse the energy information administration recently projected that higher naturalgas prices would cause coal’s share of power generation to increase from 18 percent to 22 percent in 2021obama also signed into law legislation that ended the us government’s restrictions on crudeoil exports back in 2015during the campaign biden faced tremendous pressure from the left wing of his political base to come out for policies such the green new deal and bans on fracking and other fossilfuelbased energy production biden has never been associated with such hardleft stances against economic policy and growth in the past remember even obama is to the right of where biden campaignedlets hope that president biden has a more realistic approach to energy than did candidate biden new mexico’s economic future is certainly at stake but so is the recovery of our nation’s virushobbled economyrather than instituting a blanket ban on production of oil and gas on federal lands a better approach would be to recognize the benefits and work to make sure that any production is handled responsibly and safely the growing american energy sector and american energy independence have delivered wins for the environment for consumers and for the us and state economies such as new mexico’s let’s keep it that way

contaminates regularly and precisely along with proper refueling can help not only prevent problems but can keep a reactor running in optimal shape for decades or theoretically even centuries vanderlei almeidaafp via getty images afp via getty images for thousands upon thousands of years humans have been harnessing the power of nature to provide energy to push our civilization forward by leveraging fire we gained the ability to cook food provide warmth and shelter and to protect us from predators later on we tamed a variety of animals using their labor to perform tasks that would be too strenuous or inefficient for humans eventually natural power sources like the wind was harnessed through windmills to turn millstones grinding grain without any human input at all an enormous transformation occurred when we began using natural sources — windmills steamgenerating combustion processes even flowing water — to turn turbines generating power and providing electricity today the world’s energy needs are still dominantly met through these same processes with nonrenewable fossil fuels like coal oil and gas providing the dominant fraction of earth’s energy uses we’re powering a space age civilization with the same fossil fuels that emerged during the iron age now more than ever the world needs nuclear power and yet fear rather than facts governs our policies here’s the science of why we should embrace it coal power plant in datteln germany at the dortmundemskanal coal power is among the dirtiest in the world for energy production and yet still among the worlds most ubiquitous arnold paul gralo from wikimedia commons the way a conventional chemicalbased power plant works is simple and straightforward a fuel source of some variety is burned releasing energy which heats up and boils water generating steam that steam turns a turbine which generates electricity used to provide power for whatever purposes are in demand downstream the big problem we have whether we admit it to ourselves or not is that this way of generating large amounts of energy has created enormous environmental problems while the impact of extracting these raw materials in such enormous quantities is no doubt significant the end products of combusting these fuel sources has fundamentally and significantly changed the chemical composition of earth’s atmosphere and oceans leading to global warming ocean acidification and other climaterelated effects the concentration of carbon dioxide in earths atmosphere can be determined from both ice core measurements which easily go back hundreds of thousands of years and by atmospheric monitoring stations like those atop mauna loa the increase in atmospheric co2 since the mid1700s is staggering and continues unabated current 2020 levels have permanently crested the 400 ppm threshold cires noaa the evidence that this has occurred is overwhelming and it’s a problem that we continue to exacerbate with each passing day on earth as more hydrocarbonbased fossil fuels undergo combustion they increase the concentration of carbon dioxide co 2 in earth’s atmosphere which has risen from preindustrial levels of about 270 partspermillion to modern levels of around 410 partspermillion a little more than a 50 increase in less than 300 years this carbon dioxide increase also extends to the ocean where carbon dioxide combines with water to create carbonic acid changing the ph a measure of acidity of our oceans on a global scale but the most pressing problem is the global warming that has ensued from this additional amount of carbon dioxide our global average temperature has risen by 098 °c 176 °f since we began accurately measuring it back in 1880 and that rise has accelerated having increased by 018 °c 032 °f per decade over the past 39 years the global surface average temperature for the years where such records reliably and directly exist 18802019 at present the zero line represents the longterm average temperature for the whole planet blue and red bars show the difference above or below average for each year the warming on average is by 007 c per decade but has accelerated warming at an average of 018 c since 1981 noaa climategov although many different approaches have been proposed to address this problem it’s clear that any sustainable longterm solution will include one important component a transition to energy sources that don’t result in additional carbon dioxide emissions while most of the ideas put forth — such as the hypothetical green new deal — focus on renewable energy sources like solar and wind power there’s another option that we should seriously reconsider nuclear fission power yes it’s true that fission power plants that cut corners could lead to radioactivityrelated disasters such as what infamously happened at chernobyl in 1986 meltdown is a risk occurring at three mile island in 1979 and a poorly contained reactor on a fault line could result in radioactive waste products contaminating the nearby environment due to a natural disaster such as what occurred at fukushima in 2011 but even despite these occurrences nuclear power remains safer on the whole than any other largescale power source in use over all of human history with only three disasters in more than 17000 reactoryears of activity nuclear power is safer than any other form of energy humanity has ever leveraged at this grand a scale while it has an understandable reputation for danger given the magnitude of the disaster at chernobyl and the longterm effects of radiation that reputation is not merited by the scientific facts world nuclear association the first nuclear reactors to be used for largescale power generation came online in the mid1950s and in that time there have been a total of over 17000 reactoryears where one nuclear reactor operating for a year equals one reactoryear spanning 33 countries the three aforementioned incidents are the only adverse ones to be documented in all that time and yet when people think of nuclear power they commonly think of these disasters — as well as the danger of nuclear war the hazards of radioactive waste and the destructive power of the atomic bomb — rather than the safe efficient and green energy source that nuclear power actually is thankfully the science behind nuclear power is actually simple and helps us understand why we shouldn’t fear it the same way we fear nuclear bombs or nuclear war instead there’s a wellunderstood process that goes on inside the atom and can generate enormous quantities of power enough to power our global energy needs for centuries without the polluting sideeffects of fossil fuels the uranium235 chain reaction that both leads to a nuclear fission bomb but also generates power inside a nuclear reactor is powered by neutron absorption as its first step resulting in the production of three additional free neutrons whether this becomes a bomb or a reactor depends on the richness of the fuel and the conditions that the material is kept under e siegel fastfission wikimedia commons the physics behind nuclear power in conventional chemicalbased fuels reactions occur between the electron configurations of various atoms releasing up to 00001 of the fuel’s mass as energy in nuclearbased reactions it’s the atomic nuclei themselves that are split releasing approximately 1000 times as much energy for the same amount of fuel in particular fissionable material like uranium235 only needs one simple ingredient — a neutron for the nucleus to absorb — to trigger a fission reaction although other fuels can be used the good news about nuclear power is that it’s selfsustaining each u235 nucleus that absorbs a neutron in turn emits three new neutrons when it splits apart releasing energy and sustaining the reaction so long as enough neutrons continue to interact with fissile material the reaction will occur this releases heat which is used to boil water generating steam and turning a turbine the same as a chemicalbased reactor only with nuclear there’s no carbon dioxide waste produced reactor nuclear experimental ra6 republica argentina 6 en marcha showing the characteristic cherenkov radiation from the fasterthanlightinwater particles emitted the neutrinos or more accurately antineutrinos first hypothesized by pauli in 1930 were detected from a similar nuclear reactor in 1956 centro atomico bariloche via pieck darío nuclear’s energy output is entirely controllable one of the big concerns raised with renewable sources of energy like wind and solar are that they’re not controllable if it’s not windy you don’t generate wind power if it’s not sunny or if it’s night your solar panels’ output drops tremendously but the rate of nuclear output can be controlled in a straightforward manner simply by controlling three factors control rods temperature and a medium usually water remember what causes a nuclear reaction the availability of neutrons for the fissile material to absorb if you put more or fewer control rods in you absorb more or fewer of the available neutrons changing how much interacts with the fissile material if you increase the temperature you increase the rate of the reaction if you decrease it the reaction rate drops and the presence of a medium such as water can also act as a neutron absorber but that comes at a cost you wind up with tritiated water which itself is radioactive for a period of a few decades still this is an enormous win we can generate more or less power as needed up to the plant’s maximum safe capacity uncapped fuel stored underwater in keast basin this is spent nuclear fuel at the hanford site regular inspection of used spent fuel is essential to ensure that there isnt enriched weaponsgrade material being created with proper management highlevel waste can be transformed into lowlevel waste suitable for longterm storage with extremely low risks us department of energy there’s no risk of a nuclear bomb and the waste is eminently manageable a lot of people quite understandably fear the risk of a nuclear explosion fortunately the risk of a nuclear explosion is absolutely zero when it comes to a nuclear power plant put simply the fuel used inside every nuclear reactor — as demanded by the international atomic energy agency — isn’t sufficiently enriched to make a runaway chain reaction even a possibility the material isn’t capable of creating a nuclear explosion that said there will be nuclear waste produced some of it will be useful for repurposing like the plutonium used in thermoelectric heating and energy generation for deep space missions while other material like tritiated water will need to be stored and managed according to the world nuclear association radioactive waste comes out as highlevel waste which usually needs 5 years of underwater storage followed by 45 years of dry storage allowing radioactivity and heat levels to drop and by then its become lowlevel waste which can be packaged and stored underground for longterm disposal although we still have to overcome the “not in my backyard” nimby mentality when it comes to nuclear this is essentially a scientifically solved problem on august 9 2020 unit 5 of the tianwan nuclear power plant was connected to the power grid for the first time in lianyungang city china modern nuclear power plants are even safer and more resilient than the plants which have had the bestever track record of safety throughout human history costfoto barcroft studios future publishing via getty images barcroft media via getty images we can fully transition to nuclear in under 20 years building a new countrywide or global set of reactors to power the world will require a sustained investment new power plants reactors cooling towers etc will all need to be constructed sufficient quantities of nuclear fuel will need to be mined extracted and appropriately refined supply chains will need to be constructed and waste management will be an ongoing need to address above and beyond the existing infrastructure that we have today it will require an enormous and sustained investment of resources but the payoff will come while humanity has to put it lightly done a dismal job of addressing the climate crisis up until this point that can all change if we can simultaneously replace coal gas and oilbased power plants with nuclear ones our gasolinebased automotive infrastructure to electric power industrial commercial and residential heat and power needs into electric rather than fossil fuelbased solutions we can eliminate more than 80 of our fossil fuel uses including practically all of the nonsustainable ones we can transform the world for a longterm payoff with a short but significant upfront investment whenever you undertake a new project you have to maintain your historic operating costs while you increase expenditures to implement the new expenditures while the new operating costs will eventually decrease after an initial investment potentially even below the initial levels especially if the historical operating costs can be partially removed the upfront investment shouldnt deter investors from a longterm payoff dominic turpin used with permission the uncomfortable truth is this we are a spaceage civilization that has chosen to eschew technological advances in energy generation because of fear and inertia we are powering the 21st century with 18th century technology which has had disastrous effects on our environment that we have ignored for far too long while there are many possible ways forward to address this problem nuclear power has the proven track record of success necessary and the flexibility to be an integral and potentially the primary resource in humanity’s arsenal in the fight against climate change for many years we have let fear rather than facts control the narrative over nuclear power while the conventional story around nuclear power focuses on the few disasters that have occurred nuclear’s track record tells a different story one of unparalleled safety successful waste management and abundant affordable green energy the world needs nuclear power now more than ever if we can overcome our entrenched biases against it we just might solve one of the biggest problems facing our world for generations to come

Racism,https://stoppingsocialism.com/2020/09/breonna-taylors-death-was-a-tragedy-but-not-an-example-of-systemic-racism/,jinc1019,1187,297,on september 23 kentucky attorney general daniel cameron “announced the completion of the special prosecution unit’s spu investigation into the death of ms breonna taylor” according to the report “in the early morning hours of march 13 sergeant jonathan mattingly detective brett hankison and detective myles cosgrove executed a search warrant at the home of ms breonna taylor the officers were advised by superiors to knock and announce their presence in serving this specific search warrant evidence from spu’s investigation shows that officers both knocked and announced their presence at the apartment the officer’s statements about their announcement are corroborated by an independent witness who was near in proximity to ms taylor’s apartment” this is significant the officers did not execute a noknock warrant they made their presence and intent known before they entered and a witness corroborates this the report continues “when officers were unable to get anyone to answer or open the door to the apartment the decision was made to breach the door after breaching the door sergeant mattingly was the first and only officer to enter the residence sergeant mattingly identified two individuals standing beside one another at the end of the hall a male and female in his statement he says that the male was holding a gun arms extended in a shooting stance mattingly saw the man’s gun fire heard a ‘boom’ and immediately knew he was shot as a result of feeling heat in his upper thigh” this is also significant the police officers were fired upon first they returned fire after one was hit by taylor’s boyfriend the police officers did not fire into taylor’s bedroom as she lay sleeping the report goes into greater detail about the events that occurred that fateful night based on ballistic evidence eyewitness accounts and taylor’s boyfriend’s testimony the shooting of ms taylor was indeed a terrible tragedy but not a racially charged murder unfortunately after the announcement riots and violence broke out in louisville two officers were shot during the riots yet interestingly immediately after the announcement a uhaul truck full of riot gear shields goggles weapons etc was parked and unloaded near the downtown center of louisville where the riots originated obviously this was a preplanned and coordinated effort and it speaks volumes about what is really taking place in the country from a 50000foot vantage point it also just so happens by total coincidence no doubt that huge protests took place throughout america’s cities after cameron’s press conference once again what happened in the early morning hours of march 13 in louisville was heartbreaking however the violent destructive reaction to the investigation’s findings is completely indefensible and unwarranted the notion of mob rule which is what the protesters are demanding has been incubating for months on the farleft in other words the farleft has been part and parcel to the anarchy that overtook louisville and that has destroyed countless american cities over the past six months as us attorney general bill barr said when the riots began in late may “unfortunately with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country the voices of peaceful protests are being hijacked by violent radical elements in many places it appears the violence is planned organized and driven by far left extremist groups and anarchic groups using antifalike tactics” this is a very important point that must be made loud and clear what is happening across america is not a racial reckoning it is not a grassroots movement opposed to socalled police brutality actually it is a farleft attempt to destroy the underpinnings of america “abolish the police” they say “reparations” they demand on and on they go pushing false narratives to rally misinformed americans into thinking that america is an irredeemable racist dystopia this is marxist rhetoric at its worst it is meant to divide the country along racial and class lines and it is extremely dangerous the united states is a melting pot people from all over the world come here because america is the land of opportunity america’s founding ideals including our embrace of capitalism and the rule of law is what makes america great yet there is a concerted and wellfunded effort to replace capitalism with socialism to replace the rule of law with mob rule and replace our nation’s motto of e pluribus unum with the fractious forces of balkanization the riots and disregard for the legal process that occurred in louisville is symbolic of the farleft’s quest to remake america in its socialist vision in socialist societies the rule of law does not matter and does not exist in socialism wealth redistribution and class struggle matters–not black lives or any other lives and sadly as the events of the past six months show america’s social fabric which holds us together is being torn apart at the seams by radical marxists who want to restitch our society

Toddlers’",https://www.dailywire.com/news/candace-owens-dismantles-the-big-lieof-systemic-racism-says-white-guilt-is-allowing-people-to-act-like-toddlers,Foubar,1112,196,political commentator candace owens said that a systemic feeling of “white guilt” in the united states is much more detrimental to black americans than racism and especially “systemic racism” appearing on the latest edition of the daily wire’s “the ben shapiro show sunday special” owens who has long advocated for a conservative approach to solving problems within the black community covered topics from the largest issues harming black americans today to her success in leading the socalled “blexit” movement to persuade black democrats to join the gop after the death of george floyd in may raciallycharged antipolice brutality protests broke out across the united states those protests led largely by the black lives matter organization have devolved into hundreds of riots across america’s largest cities one of the main ideas driving the social unrest is that police are unjustly targeting black americans to a large degree which owens calls a “big lie” “if you are truly sincerely a white supremacist in america the best thing you could do is do nothing and let black america tend to itself because what we do to ourselves right when left unattended to ourselves is way worse when you look at the statistics than allowing any other group to come in and try to do anything to us” owens said “and that’s including of course police officers who are not killing black americans for no reason” owens also said assertions that systemic racism is stopping black people from succeeding in the united states are meritless and that socalled “white guilt” the idea that white people living today are at least partly responsible for injustices done to black people in the past and so are responsible for black americans’ success now is keeping black americans from maturing systemic racism “is not at all an obstacle to black americans today” owens said “there is no systemic racism there is no law there is nothing that says i cannot do something as a black person that you can do so it’s completely false what we’re really talking about is the fact that people want to absolve themselves of personal responsibility and we’re being helped “if there is anything that is systemic in america today it is white guilt it’s been institutionalized it’s been politicized politicians and white people feeling bad for themselves and therefore allowing people – allowing black people and white people alike – you know antifa and black lives matter to run around and act like toddlers right” owens continued “there is an emotional immaturity that is happening in black america and it is spawned by the education system which shapes you from the time you are in kindergarten to believe that because you are black you can’t in america when you keep telling a child over and over again they can’t because they won’t right they will begin to believe in their own futility” owens addressed a recent controversy over a video she posted on instagram bashing the “media depiction” of floyd a black man who died in police custody as a “martyr for black america” floyd had a lengthy rap sheet and a history of drug abuse “we elevate people who should not be elevated and we downgrade people who should be elevated right” owens said referring to the black community in america “so condoleezza rice uncle tom larry elder coon dr ben carson stupid that’s my favorite one that a literal neurosurgeon is stupid” owens criticized republicans and conservatives for “giving up the culture war” and allowing hollywood the music industry and other entertainment outlets to dominate and create rampant misconceptions about conservatives the way to win the culture back owens said is to be unapologetic truthful and not concerned with badfaith accusations of racism and other slanders owens has been working to change black america from the inside which she says is the only way that black americans can truly succeed to do it themselves owens said the blexit movement has made large inroads into the black community since she began advocating for black people to leave the democratic party “i think for the first time there has been a lot of chatter and a lot of debate in black america about politics in general” owens said “at the height of this racial unrest there is also racial conversation i can tell you when i first got started i had no black fans it was ‘you are an uncle tom you’re a coon you’re a house negro’ and that has completely transformed i am inundated with emails from people thanking me” she also offered her thoughts on the election predicting a trump “landslide” unless mailin voting is widely adopted “trump wins i think it’s going to be by a lot unless mailin voting happens” owens said “mailin voting makes me very nervous it’s just something you can’t get a handle on but if the election goes forward and we can vote in person donald trump is going to win and i think it is going to be by a landslide” watch the daily wire is one of america’s fastestgrowing conservative media companies

of migrant childrens parents the fact is some parents don’t want their children back in their country of origin on thursday night when democratic presidential nominee joe biden angrily accused president trump of a “criminal” family separation policy that had “lost track” of more than 500 migrant children at the usmexico border he was repeating an inaccurate and misleading news report that had circulated earlier this week “what happened their kids were ripped from their arms and separated and now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone” biden said “nowhere to go nowhere to go it’s criminal” the former vice president was likely relying on a brief report from npr about the latest development in a lawsuit between the aclu and the justice department regarding the status of children who have still not been reunited with their parents after being brought across the border illegally the report claims that “the parents of 545 children still can’t be found” but that’s not quite right the npr report omitted a statement issued by department of homeland security spokesperson chase jennings explaining that in fact the vast majority of these parents have been found but have refused reunification with their children which is why the children are still in dhs custody “in the current litigation for example out of the parents of 485 children whom plaintiffs’ counsel has been able to contact they’ve yet to identify a single family that wants their child reunited with them in their country of origin” jennings said this narrative has been dispelled in the current litigation for example out of the parents of 485 children whom plaintiffs’ counsel has been able to contact theyve yet to identify a single family that wants their child reunited with them in their country of origin httpstcomz9dywwxwp — chase jennings spoxdhs october 21 2020 why would these parents refuse to be reunited with their children because their children are in the united states and they are in their country of origin most likely guatemala honduras or el salvador they don’t want their children to go back there they want them in the united states many of these parents paid exorbitant amounts of money to get their children smuggled into the us sometimes with adults posing as parents sometimes unaccompanied and with a larger group of migrants the whole point was to get their kids into the us by any means necessary even if it meant being separated indeed that’s often how “unaccompanied minors” show up on the border their parents pay smugglers called “coyotes” to bring them across illegally between the legal ports of entry as part of an agreement with the cartel that controls a particular stretch of the border trump made an allusion to this thursday night in his response to biden referencing coyotes and human smuggling by cartels the term provoked an embarrassing display of outrage on twitter from leftwing activists like jemele hill and david hogg and many others who appeared to be completely ignorant of the term—indeed wholly ignorant of the reality of human smuggling at the border—and thought trump was using “coyote” as some kind of racial epithet for the parents ok so a big takeaway from the evening is that there are apparently a lot of people who feel passionately about immigration but also have no idea about human trafficking at the border pictwittercomefy45eeolr — tsar becket adams becketadams october 23 2020 what these leftwing activists and former vice president biden have in common is an apparent belief that the border is a simple place and that family reunification a simple task nothing could be further from the truth human smuggling happens on an industrial scale along the usmexico border bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars each year for smugglers corrupt mexican officials and drug cartels which charge a perperson “tax” for every man woman and child who crosses the rio grande in an area under their jurisdiction at the height of the migrant crisis in 2019 the number of family units being apprehended at the border was at an alltime high smugglers—coyotes—would bring across large groups sometimes as many as a thousand people at once and tell them to turn themselves in to us border patrol claiming asylum nothing like this had ever happened before certainly not on this scale when it came to processing these large groups of migrants many of whom arrived suffering from dehydration and other medical problems after days in the desert us border officials faced the difficult task of trying to ascertain which adults were actually parents which were relatives claiming to be parent and which were unrelated adults posing as parents of children they didn’t know why would adults pose as parents because family units are treated differently at the border than single adults namely family units are typically held for a short time and then released with orders to appear before an immigration judge at some future date the trump administration pursued a disastrous family separation policy for a short time in 2018 which automatically separated all family units caught crossing the border illegally and resulted in some parents being deported to their countries of origin while their children remained in the us today many of those parents simply don’t want their children to return to those countries where violence and poverty are rampant should the trump administration have separated families no but there’s more to the story than that and biden along with outraged leftwing activists should take the time to learn about human smuggling at the border and the lengths to which some parents will go to ensure their kids grow up in the united states—even if it means refusing to reunite with them back home

calls it a moral good but the consequence of forcing kids into transition is denying them the ability to choose their own future when i was a child i was fascinated with makeup my grandmother would often let me sit on a small pink crushed velvet stool in her bathroom while she “put on her face” as she liked to say after putting every platinum blonde curl in place she would carefully pout her lips and apply a thin layer of ruby red lipstick i watched captivated by her transformation and the satisfaction on her face when every line every shade was perfectly applied my mother remembers catching me modeling my sister’s clothes unaware of her presence and therefore entirely unselfconscious of my movements everything about the female world inspired my imagination and i longed to be connected to it a large contributing factor into this obsession was my grandmother’s open and repeated wish that she had a beautiful granddaughter to dress up and show off at social events per my father’s wishes i was denied the ability to see my mother until i was about seven years old or so and thus my need for a female role model fell squarely on my grandmother’s shoulders my grandmother improvised highlighting my hair painting my fingernails and surrounding me exclusively with her female friends around my father i had to pretend as he grew aggressively angry whenever i presented the slightest feminine tendency at school i blended in with my female peers who seemed to appreciate having a boy to give them attention but it was safety for me the boys were cruel and aggressive and they never ceased in tormenting me daily i only felt safe and free to be myself when i was alone with women i would cry myself to sleep praying for gd to turn me into a girl when i woke up so i could finally be free from the constant stress and conflict of my daily life each day i woke up sad and afraid my struggle with gender as i grew up i learned how to mimic my male peers just enough to avoid suspicion and to exploit my gentle nature as something adults found positive around their daughters i was just “creative” or “sensitive” or as was popular at the time “in touch” with my feminine side to anyone who observed me but to me i was struggling to feel a sense of holistic unity divided by too many outside expectations that never quite fit into place i explored transgender transition as a young adult and attempted to dress as a girl change my voice and wear makeup but as the years passed none of this felt quite right eventually i found a balance between adolescent selfobsession and adult responsibility that did not allow for endless changes in identity or character and i essentially grew up who i am now is everything left over from when i gave up on trying to be someone else and for that i am grateful i have the ability to look beyond myself and understand my place in the world without requiring outside validation or romantic ideals of a perfected self i have been given the gift of selfawareness and i now find peace with the unanswered question that plagued me as far back as i can possibly remember am i a boy or a girl if i were a child today i very likely would never have been given the choice to try to find myself before the adults around me decided what was best for me i shudder to imagine how close i was to permanently disrupting my hormones physically mutilating my body and spending every waking day trying to convince everyone else i was something i knew i never would be it is stories like mine that inspire people such as matt walsh and ryan t anderson conservative advocates for children to fight on behalf of those too young to know what they are wishing for the tragedy of james younger james younger is a sevenyearold boy today ensnared in a gender battle while adults decide his fate his mother has chosen for him to live as a girl and his father has fought with every option available to prevent his son from being forced down a path he cannot conceivably choose for himself a court has ruled that james’ father does not have a say in the matter and as a country and a culture we face a choice of our own should the mother be allowed to transgender her child based on her desires for him transition for children follows a predictable model a young child is first socially transitioned through clothing socialization and identity they adopt an oppositesex name oppositesex pronouns and attend school and social events dressed as the opposite sex with children the transgender movement is extremely strict on imposing traditional gender stereotypes as the children approach puberty they are given puberty blockers to “pause” physical development until they are old enough to “decide” which sex to live as yet these blockers have lifelong negative health effects and while most children who do not take them grow out of gender dysphoria most children who do take them will not in ryan t anderson’s “when harry became sally responding to the transgender moment” a brilliant and devastating book this process is detailed in painful clarity the system is engineered to create transgender adults rather than to allow genderdysphoric children the opportunity to test out their identities until adulthood as transgender advocates market when i was about eight years old my hair reached my shoulders and was highlighted blond per my grandmother’s choices at a baseball game i was playing in despite my profound disinterest one of my dad’s friends pointed at me twirling in the outfield my golden curls playfully bouncing in the sun and asked him “who’s that little girl” my curls were promptly shorn stop depriving children of their future choices imagine if i had been encouraged to style my hair in pigtails put on makeup like my grandmother and adopt a female name at that age imagine if my puberty had been stopped and my only understanding of my “sex” was my outward appearance and socialization imagine if i entered my teenage years living as a girl for years prior and was given the chance to take hormones to grow breasts and stop my voice from deepening what “choice” would i make then how much autonomy would i really have been given to decide something that would permanently alter my physical body in such a profound way as never to recover and always require intensive medical intervention fighting for younger using the twitter hashtag protectjamesyounger walsh tweeted among many passionate calls for awareness of this cruel injustice “i have been saying literally for five years that republicans need to make opposition to radical left wing gender theory a top campaign issue it’s important and every sane human in the world would stand behind them on it” walsh is absolutely right every republicancontrolled state should be introducing legislation to make medical transition for minors illegal and provide clear parental rights for both the mother and the father in disputes over the child’s sexuality we have tolerated this far too long in the hope sanity would win out on its own we have failed these children many others have lived the life i struggled through and then made the choice to transition as adults and feel fulfilled and happy in doing so that is their right and i will defend that right but like me they had the chance to struggle with who they were and came out of it with confidence in who they wanted to be the left believes protecting children from this struggle is a moral good but the consequence is denying the child the ability to choose their own future children like me are no less important than those who do grow up to happily transition but our current system has no room for choice it is our job to fix that every genderdysphoric child deserves the right to grow up free to

according to kbtx was shared more than 10000 times the notes said “all lives matter” “you don’t belong here” and one containing the nword martin claimed “all three signs were different signs and one said ‘all lives matter’ and the other said ‘you don’t belong here’ and the other was very explicit it said the nword with a hard ‘r’” martin told kbtx “for them to tell me i don’t belong here when i have earned my spot like everybody else here and am working to get a degree like everyone else is that was just kind of hurtful because if anything i deserve to be here just as much as anybody else” texas am responded on twitter by saying “isaih we are very sorry that this happened to you please report any incidents of hate you witness online or in person at httpstophatetamuedu so it can be reviewed” martin told kbtx that he has seen things like this happen across the country but never thought it would happen to him “racism is here in college station and that problem needs to be addressed and brought up and needs to be fixed” he said am president michael k young offered 1200 to anyone providing information leading to an arrest “acts of racism are irreconcilable with the values we uphold here at texas am university those who promote hate discrimination and disrespect are not welcomed at this institution we are tired of bigoted members of our community marring the

when i first came here on my first college tour here everyone was so nice everyone was so welcoming” martin said “i never would have thought that i would have experienced this here going into my senior year i have almost spent four years in college station and when i first got here if i knew that i would have never come to am” late last week texas am police closed the investigation just as in nearly every other instance of an alleged hate crime like this police determined that the accuser was responsible for the notes “nobody has been arrested and we determined there was no offense committed” lt bobby richardson told kbtx though he wouldn’t elaborate “our investigation is closed” two days later kbtx obtained the police report regarding the incident and discovered police believe martin left the notes himself police wrote that martin parked his car at his apartment complex shortly after 1100 am and walked away martin said he returned to his car 90 minutes later to discover the notes police said there were no cameras to clearly capture what happened but nearby surveillance footage showed only a few people walking near martin’s car during that time frame none of whom were near the car long enough to post the notes martin however returned to his car during that timeframe police explained in their report martin immediately walks to the passenger side of his vehicle but does not open any doors martin is seen toward the front of his vehicle a brief white speck is seen from about midtorso of martin moving toward his vehicle another white speck is seen near his chest

for a few moments he is then seen walking around the front of his vehicle martin then enters the drivers door and drives away a few moments later the total time spent at his vehicle is 1 minute 15 seconds police said that “based on video evidence no other person had enough time to place the messages on martins car other than himself” the other people who passed martin’s vehicle police say “were not hidden for more than 5 seconds and would have had to reach over the hood to place the notes” martin told kbtx he would no longer cooperate with police and claimed there were “several things they did not include in this report” adding he believed a man walking his dog in the video may have left the notes martin will not face charges for filing a false police report because the notes contained no threat therefore no crime was committed the officer who filed the report wrote that he “was told that this fell under the 1st amendment free speech protections and that no crime had occurred” the university released a statement following the police report racism of any kind has no place at texas am i appreciate the efforts of university police who investigated with professionalism in pursuit

jbo1pl,2020-10-15 16:58:41,Republican,Every Republican Lawmaker Must Condemn Big Tech's Election Interference,https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/14/every-republican-lawmaker-must-condemn-big-techs-election-interference/#.X4de4_QTIgc.twitter,Foubar,942,128,big tech has openly declared a partisan war against american news consumers as the only party defending the first amendment the gop needs to declare war right back the actions of facebook and twitter today represent nothing less than a brazen attempt by corrupt big tech partisans who intend to steal the election from the american people on wednesday morning the new york post published a blockbuster story — complete with emails documents and photographs — detailing the efforts of democrat presidential candidate joe biden’s son hunter to sell his father’s influence to foreign oligarchs with an interest in swaying american foreign policy to support their own business efforts and by wednesday afternoon monopolistic social media giants facebook and twitter moved to throttle and even outright ban circulation of the new york post story there’s no need to speculate on why they did this there is no justification for safety or the public interest no one’s life was put at risk by this information they took these actions for blatantly partisan reasons they want joe biden to win the announcements themselves came from partisans who traded their political access for careers in silicon valley when twitter earlier this year banned the president of the united states — the leader of the free world — from tweeting a video to an interview he did on the largest cable news network in the country it announced that action via nick pacilio a former communications staffer for democratic vice presidential kamala harris facebook’s announcement that it would throttle access to the new york post’s investigative reporting came via andy stone a former democratic congressional and campaign staffer who worked for barbara boxer and john kerry as of this moment every american voter is currently banned from linking to news reported by one of the largest papers in one of the largest states in the country even the new york post’s primary twitter account has been locked — they claim the hunter biden stories violate their rules against the “distribution of hacked material” — something that apparently didn’t matter regarding president trump’s illegally obtained tax returns twitter users can’t even direct message the story that’s how much ceo jack dorsey doesn’t want you to know what’s in it this represents far more than a oneoff incident of an algorithm mistakenly censoring an article or user post instead it is a coordinated declaration of partisan war on america’s electoral process by the unelected tech oligarch class against the american people making use of the monopoly power and federal legal immunity afforded to these globalist overlords by the us congress and federal antitrust authorities the latest effort to ban americans from reading news about candidates for federal office represents an intentional and very public information coup it’s long past time that the lawmakers who represent the country stand up and say enough is enough they will no longer be able to muzzle the american public or its first amendment free press under color of license via section 230 of the communications decency act that particular section of federal law immunizes digital platforms from certain speech published by its users or other thirdparties and even though the law gives them no protection for statements or actions they take as publishers many courts and most dcbased tech policy nonprofits have been either conned or purchased into believing that facebook twitter and google are similarly exempt from any liability for what those institutions themselves publish of their own volition thus a law drafted to protect companies from civil liability for removing thirdpartyposted illegal content like child pornography is now being used as a shield against all liability and a sword against any individual or institution who posts something that conflicts with the leftwing views of the silicon valley technorati this week supreme court justice clarence thomas indicated this is an issue the court is ready to consider if a congress heavily influenced by big tech money will not “when congress enacted the statute most of today’s major internet platforms did not exist” he wrote “and in the 24 years since we have never interpreted this provision but many courts have construed the law broadly to confer sweeping immunity on some of the largest companies in the world” “extending §230 immunity beyond the natural reading of the text can have serious consequences” he added noting that while the issue is not before the court yet “in an appropriate case it behooves us to do so” america’s elected republicans should not wait for the court if silicon valley insists in the vein of george orwell’s unfortunately prophetic ingsoc on enforcing newspeak guidelines regardless of their relation to reality thereby declaring openly partisan war against american news consumers then the elected representatives of the only major political party left in america that still believes in and defends the first amendment needs to declare war right back for years big tech did nothing to stop the vicious and false russian collusion hoax which was perpetrated on the american people by russian agent christopher steele and suspected russian spy igor danchenko for years big tech had no problem with foreign election meddlers using its platforms to cripple the american presidency big tech was fine with corrupt ukrainian oligarchs using illegal leaks and fake news to attempt the literal overthrow and ouster of the us president instead they expressed their deep concern about the influence of laughable memes of jesus endorsing donald trump big tech’s quislings will claim that they treat all information the same that they would never put their dirty thumbs on the scale in favor of one party or ideological movement over the other and that even if they did there are reasons why this or that is a special case but everyone with eyes to see knows the truth by now that’s nonsense enough is enough lawmakers can stand by and watch big tech steamroll information in an unamerican attempt to manipulate our elections while muzzling hundreds of millions of americans or they can stand up and drive a spoke in the wheel
jcdsdl,2020-10-16 20:07:44,Republican,'The Democratic party left us': how rural Minnesota is making the switch to Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/16/minnesota-democrat-switch-trump-election,,948,94,ask larry cuffe why after decades of voting for democrats he voted for donald trump four years ago and he’ll talk about his distrust of hillary clinton and the need to get northern minnesota’s mines back to work ask the former police officer why he’s sticking with trump in 2020 and the list is very much longer “the democratic party left us even in the past four years it’s changed so much supporting people who riot defunding the police that’s crazy i think a lot of us up here are democrats in republican clothing now” he said cuffe who twice voted for barack obama is one of six mayors from a stretch of minnesota mining country known as the iron range who turned their back on the democratic party and signed a joint letter endorsing trump even as the state is swinging behind the president’s opponent joe biden the mayors said that after decades of voting for democrats they no longer regarded the party as advocating for workers “lifelong politicians like joe biden are out of touch with the working class out of touch with what the country needs and out of touch with those of us here on the iron range and in small towns like ours across our nation” they said a truck passes a sign in support of donald trump near rochester minnesota photograph eric millerreuters the mayors praised trump for standing up to china cutting taxes and said he “fought for the working class” “now four years later the iron range is roaring back to life and for the first time in a very long time locals are hopeful because of this president’s policies and willingness to fight for us” the mayors said in their endorsement after losing minnesota by less 15 of the vote four years ago trump imagined he might take the midwestern state this year it was a potential prize that if it fell into the president’s lap would almost certainly mean biden also lost the crucial neighboring swing states of wisconsin and michigan that now appears to be increasingly unlikely for trump as opinion polls consistently give biden a lead in minnesota of six points or more with early voting already under way but the mayors cling to hope that trump can once again pull off the unexpected with the help of a region where many traditionally democrat voters who backed the president four years ago have not been drawn back to the party this year large numbers were alienated by clinton as a candidate in 2016 but since then a gap has opened up with the broader democratic party and biden has failed to bridge it the once heavily unionized iron range is part of one of the few congressional districts to flip to the republicans in the otherwise disastrous 2018 midterms for trump as voters in the region liked his showdown with china over steel dumping and a promise to clear the way for vast new mines blocked by obama two years later support for trump appears to have strengthened further following the protests and civil unrest in minneapolis the state’s largest city in the aftermath of george floyd’s death and amid demands to defund the police cuffe is also hostile to a new breed of democratic politicians who talk of “socialism” and scrap immigration enforcement but the immediate issue that drew the mayors and other democrats to trump in the iron range was mining the source of the region’s fading prosperity and on that they say he has delivered andrea zupancich a real estate agent and parttime mayor of the small city of babbitt who also voted for obama and signed the letter in support of trump twice testified to congress that china dumping cheap steel on the us was killing her community the trump administration claims to have created hunreds of new mining jobs and increased miners’ wages in minnesota mining country photograph jim moneap she said the imports drove down demand for iron ore from the mines around babbitt which cost jobs battered the local economy and drove people to leave the city “we were pleading with obama to do something about this he started doing a little bit and then it just kind of fizzled” she said zupancich credits trump for standing up to china by imposing tariffs on its steel that she says has injected new life into the industry in the us and the iron range “the tariffs that is causing an equal playing field for the selling of our steel so we’ve noticed an increase in the mines’ production we see that they’re hiring people they’re putting money back into the mines they’re planning on mining for a while” she said the trump administration claims to have driven up iron ore production in the region by nearly onethird to have created hundreds of new mining jobs and to have increased miners’ wages steve bonach president of the local united steelworkers union branch said trump’s claims are overblown “i’m not for saying trump is saving the steel industry he promised in some of the advertisements he was going to open six new steel mills he hasn’t opened new mills he’s shut them down” said bonach who emphasizes that he is speaking for himself not the union “we have a mill in detroit that is closed it got all its iron ore pellets from here he talked to them people there and said he was gonna get it running and it’s not running there’s still two other mills of ours that are down so it’s still struggling it’s still a challenge” but bonach acknowledged that many of his members who might have voted democratic in the past now support trump “he’s thrown out the tariff thing he’s riding that up here i ain’t saying he didn’t help it’s helped but overall i’m not sure it’s changed very much” he said a closed steel plant near hoyt lakes minnesota was later awarded to a planned copper and nickel mine in 2016 photograph jim moneap there was also widespread anger in the region after obama blocked a vast copper and nickel mine in minnesota’s superior national forest that the owners said would last for decades trump lifted the block “we are sitting on a half a trillion dollars’ worth of copper and nickel” said zupancich “we import all our nickel whereas we could provide 90 of the world’s nickel and the state would really benefit the mining taxes pay for our schools for the entire state” the plan ran into opposition from minnesota democrats over environmental concerns to zupancich it didn’t make sense if a ban on mining in northern minnesota means the minerals then come from countries such as china or russia with lower environmental and other standards “minnesota has the strictest standards in mining and safety green energy turbines need copper nickel platinum cobalt which we have here we import it from countries that have child labour no strict safety standards no environmental standards and we do have that here so we want to make sure it’s done and we want to make sure it’s done right trump understands that” she said but if it was mining that drew democrats in the iron range to trump four years ago many are sticking with him because they feel even more alienated from their former party trump supporters wave flags as the president delivers remarks on jobs and the economy on 17 august photograph kerem yucelafpgetty images cuffe a military veteran watched the protests and destruction in minneapolis following the death of george floyd and what he regards as the democrats complicity in it with despair he scoffs at the calls to defund the police he’s shocked that minneapolis council passed an ordinance to dismantle the city’s force “i think reform is always a good route but when you vote to just completely defund the police it creates a myriad of problems we’re an armed society we are a very tumultuous society right now a very violent society and a very divided country we need the police” he said cuffe ticked off other frustrations including a claim that “we are gravitating toward the actually erasing our entire history of the united states by pulling down these monuments” but he acknowledged that the reckoning with the past is a reflection of shifting priorities and politics of many democratic voters in other parts of the country “you have millennials and younger people that want to come in and try to shape their way of life you could support it or not support it” he said zupancich too is alarmed by the talk of democratic socialism and what she regards as a fartooradical wave of young democrats exemplified by ilhan omar – the minnesota member of congress who is the first woman of colour to hold national elective office in the state still mining remains at the core of the presidential race in the iron range bonach said he does not believe that biden is opposed to mining but he said there is a strong perception in the region that the democrats as a whole are and that has a big impact “the perception is harming biden there’s no doubt about it the usw will make sure biden does the right thing” he said

Ted Cruz: Treat China Like It's The New Soviet Union,https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/02/sen-ted-cruz-treat-china-like-its-the-new-soviet-union/,Foubar,942,50,sen ted cruz has been a stalwart opponent of the chinese communist party ccp the texas republican has put forth numerous pieces of legislation aimed at countering the ccp through exposing its control over american media halting its exploitation of our airwaves preventing it from dominating strategically significant economic sectors that would imperil us national security and taking aim at its tyranny i sat down with cruz for a broad discussion on uschina policy what follows is a lightly edited transcript of our june 25 conversation ben weingarten what in your view does the chinese communist party ultimately seek to achieve if it were to achieve it what would that mean for the life of every american sen ted cruz nothing short of world domination the objective of the chinese communist government is to become the preeminent superpower on the face of the earth the preeminent military power the preeminent economic power and to dictate its will across the globe i believe china poses the most significant geopolitical threat for the united states over the next century because its ambitions are unlimited and its record of torture murder lies and oppression would only grow worse were china to achieve its objective of global superiority weingarten some including even china hawks claim the ccp does not really consist of communists i think david goldman has said there are more communists in the harvard area than there are at the upper echelon of the ccp how would you describe the regime’s ideology cruz i’m not sure those two geographies are mutually exclusive communism in practice has never been about ideology there are the communist academics in the west for whom marxism is a lazy intellectual pursuit and they envision a communist utopia where human nature disappears utterly devoid of the realities the world has seen with every communist dictatorship that has ever occurred in practice communism is about power domination and almost inevitably it has resulted in poverty and misery the chinese communist party desires to exercise complete control over the chinese citizenry their speech their religion their economic activities and over everything they say do or think every minute of the day with technology that specter is becoming more and more of a reality communist governments consistently engage in massive surveillance of their citizens to brutally punish and eliminate the sense xi jinping is quite content to be an absolute dictator the steps the communist government will take to preserve its power have been tragically illustrated for the entire world this year when heroic whistleblowers in china physicians tried to call the attention of china and the world to the newly discovered coronavirus the chinese communist government imprisoned those whistleblowers punished those whistleblowers forced them to recant what they had said and deliberately covered up the outbreak had the chinese government behaved like any responsible government had it sent in health professionals and quarantined the infected people there is a very real possibility that this could have been contained as a regional outbreak instead it became a global pandemic costing the lives of over 400000 people worldwide and destroying trillions of dollars across the globe the chinese government willingly with no hesitation allowed those 400000 lives to be lost because trying to save face trying to delay revelation of the outbreak was more important than a halfmillion human lives weingarten should america decouple from china what should that decoupling consist of and how should we go about achieving it cruz i think the most important foreign policy consequence of the coronavirus pandemic is going to be a fundamental reassessment of the united states’ relationship with china for far too long voices in washington in both parties have been content to be apologists for china to minimize the risk to excuse the oppression the torture the murder the lies all in search of an extra dollar they believed we could make in global commerce over the coming years i hope we see a significant decoupling from china now that doesn’t mean completely and utterly severing all economic ties we’re able to engage in commerce with our competitors and with our enemies what it does mean is being absolutely cleareyed about who the chinese communists are and the fact that they are our enemies it also means not allowing the united states to be vulnerable to chinese communist aggression the chinese government has systematically targeted critical infrastructure the critical needs in the us economy and in the lives of american citizens i believe we need to fundamentally alter our supply chain so that critical infrastructure is not dependent on china the chinese government deliberately strategically and systematically targeted pharmaceutical production creating cartels to drive out of business us production and draw much of global production into china so that we are today incredibly dependent on china for a host of pharmaceuticals — from antibiotics to blood pressure medicine to heart medicine to alzheimer’s drugs to cancer drugs to antianxiety and depression drugs — not to mention ppe from masks and gloves to gowns in the midst of this pandemic at least one statecontrolled media outlet in china explicitly threatened to cut off lifesaving pharmaceuticals from the united states as a tool of economic warfare if it were to do so that wouldn’t be economic warfare it would be actual warfare it would be quite literally threatening the lives potentially of millions of americans it makes no sense for the united states to allow our citizens’ health and safety and life to be dependent on the whims and good graces of the chinese communist government so i am leading the fight in the senate to move our critical infrastructure and lifesaving necessities out of china and back to america likewise when it comes to rareearth minerals china has systematically targeted what it perceives as structural vulnerabilities for us national security and for the us economy driving out of business us production of rareearth minerals and making america dependent on china allowing that to continue is foolishness that’s why i’ve introduced legislation the ore act to create strong incentives to bring back to the united states the mining and production of rareearth minerals so that from national security to high tech we are not captive to china’s stranglehold extortion weingarten how do we ultimately triumph in the realm of 5g networking technology and more broadly given china’s statebacked efforts to dominate in every major technological field and willingness to lie cheat steal and operate on a completely economic basis how does our at least relatively free market approach ultimately triumph cruz because we’re stronger and the principles our nation was founded upon worked much better than do the principles of totalitarian dictatorship upon which the chinese regime is based what we need is a comprehensive strategy to combat and defeat the chinese communist government the best modern analogy is ronald reagan’s vision for standing up to and defeating the soviet union like modernday communist china the soviet union was an evil repressive regime exporting misery and suffering across the globe and engaged in a local struggle for power with the united states the reagan administration spearheaded by leaders such as ambassador jeane kirkpatrick began by having a cleareyed assessment of who the enemy was when reagan described the soviet union as an “evil empire” the intelligentsia here in washington gasped and clutched their pearls when reagan rightly predicted that marxismleninism would end up on the ash heap of history once again the supposedly sophisticated analysts in the academy in the thinktank world in the press and in the establishments of both the democratic party and republican party all shook their heads at the simplemindedness of this western cowboy who’d come to occupy the white house when reagan stood just a few hundred yards from the brandenburg gate and uttered the immortal words “mr gorbachev tear down this wall” that clarity those words that vision did more to liberate humanity than any words from any leader in modern times the reagan administration rebuilt our military implemented the strategic defense initiative cut taxes cut regulations supercharged the economy highlighted the human rights abuses and atrocities of the soviet union … and all of that together combined to bankrupt the soviet union as it could not keep up its failed economic system could not keep up with the might of american free enterprise nor could it keep up with the blinding power of truth and sunlight communist dictatorships fear truth and sunlight we need that same clarity when it comes to china in the senate i have endeavored to shine the light over and over and over again on chinese lies and oppression and murder …one example several years ago i introduced legislation to rename the street in front of the chinese embassy “liu xiaobo plaza” after the famed nobel peace laureate in china who was wrongfully imprisoned multiple times i went to the senate floor seeking to pass that legislation multiple times sen dianne feinstein came to the floor to object it she and i argued back and forth on the senate floor she said “if we do this it will embarrass the chinese government” to which i responded “that’s not a bug it’s a feature that is the objective is to embarrass these murdering tyrannical thugs” the strategy was a strategy borrowed from reagan reagan likewise renamed the street in front of the soviet embassy “sakharov plaza” after the famed soviet dissident after feinstein had objected repeatedly to my legislation i decided to use greater leverage to move it forward i placed a hold on every state department nominee that president obama put forward the obama administration was deeply dismayed at this use of leverage and came to me asking “what can we do to get you to lift the hold” i said “it’s very simple pass my legislation get feinstein to lift her objection” they asked “can we just pass the resolution instead” i said “no i want binding legislation that directs the street name be renamed” ultimately the obama administration relented feinstein withdrew her objection and the legislation passed the senate 100 to nothing now sadly that legislation was scuttled in the republicancontrolled house of representatives when rep jason chaffetz refused to allow it to move forward i tried to intervene directly with chaffetz but he expressed the same desire that feinstein had expressed not to embarrass the chinese government ultimately however that legislation produced meaningful change when the trump administration began liu xiaobo had passed away but his widow liu xia was still in china — held against her will not allowed to leave the country indeed she had never been able to collect the prize money for her husband having won the nobel peace prize i had breakfast with thensecretary of state rex tillerson and he told me in his discussions with his chinese counterparts when they enumerated their topthree diplomatic objectives among them was preventing the street being renamed in front of their embassy pause for a second to reflect why that objective was so high on their diplomatic priorities the chinese regime fears sunlight it fears the truth part of the beauty of reagan’s strategy with sakharov plaza was that at any time you wanted to write a letter any time you wanted to give directions to the embassy you had to acknowledge the name of the dissident to speak it out loud tyranny thrives in darkness i told tillerson to feel free to use me as the bad guy that i intended to continue to press to pass the legislation i believed we could get it done and i pointed out we’d already succeeded in passing it unanimously through the senate once so this threat was real and tangible but i also told tillerson he could tell the chinese if they released liu xia i would stop pressing this particular fight shortly thereafter china released liu xia that is one example of just how terrified china is of their tyranny being exposed another example was the hysterical reaction china had to the houston rockets’ general manager daryl morey sending one benign tweet about hong kong “fight for freedom stand with hong kong” i’m a houstonian and a diehard rockets fan so i know who morey is but most of the world did not until the chinese government dramatically overreacted threatening punitive economic measures which resulted in corporate america groveling the nba effusively apologizing to the chinese overlords multiple nba stars praising the chinese beneficence and nike eagerly complicit with the chinese government’s censorship all of that showed first the power china exercises — that its principal means of power today is economic rather than directly military american companies global companies are so eager for access to the chinese market that they will willingly be lap dogs to whatever chinese censorship the communist party demands hollywood is another example of this slavish obedience second that massive overreaction shows just how terrified the chinese regime is of the 2 million people marching for freedom in hong kong that’s why in october of last year when i traveled to asia i flew to pearl harbor then japan then taiwan then india and then hong kong it was designed to be a tour of major friends and allies surrounding china the entire focus of the trip was the growing and massive threat china poses when i was in hong kong i met with the democracy protesters and activists i dressed in all black and did a sunday show via satellite dressed in all black in solidarity with the protesters because it is that sunlight china fears now combined with that sunlight combined with that highlighting of dissidence combined with that highlighting of china’s oppression torture and murder we need real and meaningful legislation and policy to decouple our economy and protect ourselves from vulnerability that’s why i’ve introduced over a dozen pieces of legislation focused on rareearth minerals pharmaceutical research development and manufacturing hollywood censorship communist party propaganda in the united states over the airwaves and censorship from the chinese regime that resulted in the coronavirus global pandemic and took the lives of over 400000 people that’s why i’m continuing to press on every front to use every tool every lever we have to win the global strategic competition with the chinese communist government

me reade tweeted about her mother who died in 2016 biden skates through tv interviews as anchors avoid questions about tara reades assault claim reades story first resurfaced in an article in the

up against the wall reade said that she was wearing “a business skirt” but “wasn’t wearing stockings — it was a hot day” she continued “his hands were on me and underneath my clothes and he went down my skirt and then up inside it and he penetrated me with his fingers and he was kissing me at the same time and he was saying some things to me” reade claimed biden first asked if she wanted “to go somewhere else” “i pulled away he got finished doing what he was doing” reade said “he said ‘come on man i heard you liked me’” reade said she tried to share her story last year but nobody listened to her earlier this month she filed a criminal complaint against biden with police in washington dc fox news reached out to the biden campaign on friday for comment the campaign referred fox news to a

reade said always listen to your mom always listen to your mom an emotional reade told fox news still the mother’s interview doesn’t specifically corroborate reade’s latest allegations of assault and could be referring more to the bullying allegations she raised last year in a 2020 interview reade laid more blame with biden’s staffers for “bullying her” than with biden himself the washington post reported reade has come forward before last year when multiple women emerged claiming inappropriate touching by biden reade at the time claimed biden put his hands on her shoulders and rubbed his fingers up and down her neck but was unable to gain traction on her story aside from an article in a local newspaper but in recent weeks reade told a far more graphic account with different and more

fact mitch mcconnell has the votes secured and her nomination will move forward she will get a vote in the senate before election day she will be the ninth justice all that said her road to that seat on the country’s highest court will be a bumpy one for her and her family it began before she was even formally announced on saturday by president trump i noticed that a particularly nasty line of attack was developing against acb friday night on twitter a democrat staffer and activist posted a thread pondering if the adoption process for her two haitianborn children was legit the person even implied that maybe the children were snatched up and taken out of haiti by “ultrareligious americans” senator josh hawley noticed and posted a response outing the democrat staffer read this from democrat activist hill staffer questioning whether amyconeybarrett illegally adopted her children from haiti maybe snatching them from birth parents this is the dem gameplan nothing but raw bigotry and hate i promise you this will not stand pictwittercomjemqhe05dy — josh hawley hawleymo september 26 2020 that person’s twitter account is now private the twit is a coward this kind of personal attack on the children of public figures is gutwrenching acb keeps her family private during her 2017 confirmation hearing for the 7th circuit court of appeals she spoke of her seven children a rare occurrence five children are biological children two are adopted also her youngest child is a special needs child he has downs syndrome “emma is 16 the first apple of our eye” amy said during the hearing “vivian directly next to emma is 13 vivian is our miracle vivian joined our family—she was born in haiti and she came home when she was 14 months old and she weighed 11 pounds and she was so weak we were told she might never walk normally or speak today vivian is a track star and i assure you she has no trouble talking tess sitting next to vivian is also 13 years old both in 8th grade she’s one of the most compassionate and determined people that i know” “john peter is 10 and like vivian he was born in haiti he joined our family in 2010 when he was 3 years old after the devastating earthquake in haiti” she said “liam is 8 typically curious 8yearold and juliet is our spunky 6yearold benjamin our youngest is 5 and benjamin has special needs and that presents unique challenges for all of us but i think all you need to know about benjamin’s place in the family is summed up by the fact the other children unreservedly identify him as their favorite sibling” that was three years ago now vivian is 16 years old and john peter is 13 they will hear and read all the ugliness thrown at their family their friends will question them about it too it’s unnecessary stress on minor children purely for political reasons it’s disgusting it brought back memories of the confirmation hearings of john roberts in 2005 at that time it was the new york times doing the bidding of democrats a reporter was investigating the private adoption of his children roberts’ children were even younger than the barrett children – josie was 5 years old and jack was 4 the washington post ran a story ridiculing the clothes the children wore for their father’s announcement today a tweeter went after acb for “weaponizing her white womanhood” as a power grab and accused her of using her children as political props her twitter account is now private too these hideous people are brave keyboard warriors until they start to get some blowback and then they hide behind private accounts reporter kelly o’donnell tweeted a short video of acb and her “large family” leaving their home in indiana to travel to washington dc this morning these kinds of nuanced jabs will continue too next

one tweet from a liberal woman complaining that acb only has three years on the 7th circuit someone quickly educated her that justice kagen had no time on any bench so… democrat senators are showing their pettiness by stating they will not even bother to meet with acb as is tradition before confirmation hearings frankly that works out fine by me it will speed up the process chuck schumer is leading the charge that acb’s appointment on the supreme court means the end of health care and everyone will die or something democrats are really hammering on the trump administration’s lawsuit against obamacare now pending in the supreme court they claim that scare tactics about health care coverage worked for them in the 2018 election cycle and they intend to do the same now for the november general election “by nominating judge barrett to the supreme court president trump has put americans’ health care at grave risk” schumer said at an afterdark press conference in new york city “and as covid19 continues and we need more health care the nomination by president trump of amy coney barrett will mean less health care for over 100 million americans” “health care is the most important issue on the ballot to americans and as americans learn judge barrett’s views on health care and so many other issues she will become less and less popular and hopefully they will call their senators and say ‘don’t vote for someone who will take away my health care” schumer said the american people should make no mistake a vote by any senator for judge amy coney barrett is a vote to eliminate health care for millions in the middle the covid19 pandemic democrats are fighting for americans health care — chuck schumer senschumer september 26 2020 republicans are having a little fun

The Academics can't distinguish feminism from nazism",https://quillette.com/2018/10/01/the-grievance-studies-scandal-five-academics-respond/,swiet,874,166,editor’s note for the past year scholars james lindsay helen pluckrose and peter boghossian have sent fake papers to various academic journals which they describe as specialising in activism or “grievance studies” their stated mission has been to expose how easy it is to get “absurdities and morally fashionable political ideas published as legitimate academic research” to date their project has been successful seven papers have passed through peer review and have been published including a 3000 word excerpt of adolf hitler’s mein kampf rewritten in the language of intersectionality theory and published in the gender studies journal affilia below is a response to the scandal from five academics who are currently researching publishing and teaching in the fields of philosophy english studies behavioral genetics and economics nathan cofnas is reading for a dphil in philosophy at the university of oxford his work focuses on the philosophy of biology broadly construed he has published on such topics as innateness the ethical implications of individual differences in intelligence and jewish cultural evolution you can follow him on twitter nathancofnas twenty years ago alan sokal called postmodernism “fashionable nonsense” today postmodernism isn’t a fashion—it’s our culture a large proportion of the students at elite universities are now inducted into this cult of hate ignorance and pseudophilosophy postmodernism is the unquestioned dogma of the literary intellectual class and the art establishment it has taken over most of the humanities and some of the social sciences and is even making inroads in stem fields it threatens to melt all of our intellectual traditions into the same oozing mush of political slogans and empty verbiage postmodernists pretend to be experts in what they call “theory” they claim that although their scholarship may seem incomprehensible this is because they are like mathematicians or physicists they express profound truths in a way that cannot be understood without training lindsay boghossian and pluckrose expose this for the lie that it is “theory” is not real postmodernists have no expertise and no profound understanding critics of sokal point out that his paper was never subjected to peer review and they say it was unfair to expect the editors of social text to spot errors concerning math and science this time there are no excuses lbp’s papers were fully peer reviewed by leading journals the postmodernist experts showed that they had no ability to distinguish scholarship grounded in “theory” from deliberate nonsense and faulty reasoning mixed in with hate directed at the disfavored race white and sex “cis” male king solomon said of the fool “his talk begins as foolishness and ends as evil madness” ecclesiastes 1013 can a disregard for evidence logic and open inquiry combined with a burning hatred for large classes of people perceived as political opponents “racists” “sexists” “homophobes” “transphobes” etc possibly lead to a good result the editors and peer reviewers who handled lbp’s papers have revealed their true vicious attitudes the flagship feminist philosophy journal hypatia accepted a paper not yet published online arguing that social justice advocates should be allowed to make fun of others but no one should be permitted to make fun of them the same journal invited resubmission of a paper arguing that “privileged students shouldn’t be allowed to speak in class at all and should just listen and learn in silence” and that they would benefit from “experiential reparations” that include “sitting on the floor wearing chains or intentionally being spoken over” the reviewers complained that this hoax paper took an overly compassionate stance toward the “privileged” students who would be subjected to this humiliation and recommended that they be subjected to harsher treatment is asking people of a certain race to sit on the floor in chains better than asking them to wear a yellow star what exactly is this leading to the battle was lost long ago — neema parvini english studies neema parvini is a senior lecturer in english at the university of surrey and is a proud member of the heterodox academy as well as the evolution institute he has has written five books the latest of which is shakespeare’s moral compass he is currently working on a new book for palgrave macmillan called the defenders of liberty human nature individualism and property rights a study of 500 years of thinking about freedom in the west from machiavelli to milton friedman follow him on twitter neemaparvini1 the news that these journals are nakedly ideological will not surprise many of those who work within the disciplines of the humanities in the modern academy now the ticking off of buzzwords seems to stand in for checking the quality of scholarship or the coherence of arguments the battle was lost around 1991 around that time the great historian of the tudor period gr elton had been fighting rearguard action for the discipline he loved he saw history in the tradition of leopold von ranke a meticulous examination of the primary evidence and a refusal to allow presentday concerns or attitudes to colour the subject matter but traditional history like all other disciplines came under attack elton fumed that the younger generation was on “the intellectual equivalent of crack” addicted to the “cancerous radiation that comes from the foreheads of derrida and foucault”1 but elton lost the day to hayden white who “deconstructed” history by complaining that many historians continue to treat their “facts” as though they were “given” and refuse to recognize unlike most scientists that they are not so much “found” as “constructed” by the kinds of questions which the investigator asks of the phenomena before him2 white’s point is that there can be no such thing as “objectivity” in history it is merely a form of storytelling driven by the subjective interests of the scholar accordingly historians now sought to rebuild their discipline “on assumptions that directly challenge the empiricist paradigm”3 in literary studies the radical feminist hélène cixous argued that the ideology of patriarchy was all around us “a kind of vast membrane enveloping everything” a “skin” that “encloses us like a net or like closed eyelids”4how could anyone lay claim to “objectivity” in such conditions by 1991 such thinking had become de rigueur in an essay called “the myth of neutrality again” the feminist critic gayle greene wrote bluntly feminists and marxists who hold opinions that are not generally accepted get called “ideological” and “political” “partisan” “polemical” and lots of other things whereas those approaches which are more traditional closer to what is familiar … get to pass as “neutral” and “objective” … a fundamental premise of feminist scholarship is that the perspective assumed to be “universal” that has dominated knowledge shaping its paradigms and methods has actually been male and culturebound i find it astonishing this needs repeating5 where some of us might see niccolò machiavelli francis bacon john locke thomas hobbes rene descartes or david hume palpably struggling with the deepest questions of political philosophy or epistemology cixious or greene see only dead white men what they say matters less to them than who was saying it thus the competing systems of knowledge that came out of the enlightenment – rationalism and empiricism – are both alwaysalready tainted as “products of the patriarchy” it has been the explicit goal of postmodernity to reject reason and evidence they want a “new paradigm” of knowledge should it come as any surprise to us then that their journals will publish explicit nonsense such as the papers authored by lindsay pluckrose and

apparently absorbing interest in zerofree regions for multivariate tutte polynomials alias pottsmodel partition functions of graphs and matroids sokal naughtily submitted to the journal social text a lampoon manuscript that married poststructuralist gobbledegook with physics catchphrases they published it it has garnered 1526 citations sokal’s spoof took aim at obscure language and epistemic relativism but his quarry escaped now three academics have submitted twenty spoof manuscripts to journals chosen for respectability in their various disciplines seven papers were accepted before the experiment stopped more are surviving peer review this new raid on screamingly barmy pseudoscholarship is the alan sokal opening weaponised like dedicated traceurs in a parkourfest the trio scrambled over the terrain of what they call grievance studies and they dropped firecrackers one published paper proposed that dog parks are “rapecondoning spaces” another entitled “our struggle is my struggle solidarity feminism as an intersectional reply to neoliberal and choice feminism” reworked and substantially altered part of mein kampf the most shocking not published its status is “revise and resubmit” is a “feminist approach to pedagogy” it proposes “experiential reparations” as a corrective for privileged students these include sitting on the floor wearing chains or being purposely spoken over reviewers have commented that the authors risk exploiting underprivileged students by burdening them with an expectation to teach about privilege these psychoactive hoax papers some penned in just a few hours are taken seriously because they fit with social science sub fields in which reason has been exchanged for ideology how did we get here did it begin with scholars wanting to right social wrongs a wish to emphasise within academic writing the value of treating one another fairly of reducing or eliminating discrimination on grounds of ancestry disability sex or sexual orientation perhaps such scholars were fed up with an implicit hierarchical model of academic discourse in which like the wrongheaded march of progress apestoman illustration poetry sits meekly at the left of the line while biology chemistry physics and mathematics strut proudly at the far right triumphal end if scholars wanted to reduce bias and barriers the wrong fights have been picked here are just three problems with parts of academia that this new manuscript hoax has exposed the first is a battle with language readers are illserved by opaque writing text can be hardgoing because of its specialised content such as string theory or hard to decode because it has been written to sexily seduce the reader into slowly undressing the meaning such as poetry take for example the metaphysicals but the shamed hoaxed journals too often host unintelligible waffle clear writing is not a matter of style it’s a matter of clear thinking the dogpark hoax paper honoured by the journal as exemplary scholarship contains gems like this “dog parks are microcosms where hegemonic masculinist norms governing queering behavior and compulsory heterosexuality can be observed in a crossspecies environment” it looks like a case of reviewers asleep at the wheel secondly for academia to be worth anything it is crucial that reviewers and editors understand what any particular experimental design can deliver this holds for quantitative qualitative and postqualitative whatever that is research reviewers and editors must object when results or interpretation overreach the methods if a hypothesis is unfalsifiable it doesn’t hurt to say so the function of empirical work is to steer us closer to the truth about the world it is therefore crucial to distinguish between what can constitute evidence and what cannot lastly and most importantly there is evidence from this experiment and from the literature in which it is embedded of a great change in perceptions about what constitutes vice when i grew up something like the following order of badness prevailed murder the worst followed by serious physical violence cheating and lying nasty shouting nasty speaking and at the milder end nasty thinking this has changed there is evidence that many scholars favour punitive thoughtreform orwell had a word for this it is emblematic of that huge change that i feel queasy here at risk of being misquoted when i say that a sexist racist or foolish thought or comment is likely to be punished with what was formerly reserved for someone who throws a punch at the dean’s snout this while actual scientific waffle—and worse—is published without criticism another sign is the widespread use of that dead metric the implicit association test which should long ago have been put out of its misery with a shot of pentobarbital where the hell is orwell when we need him we’ve sleepwalked into a cultural revolution in our own backyard and i fear we have not seen the worst yet what to do make the academic literature freely available to the public tear down the paywalls at least then people could see what we are up to that would be a start philosophy’s carefully guarded secret — neven sesardic philosophy neven sesardic is a croatian philosopher who has taught philosophy at universities in croatia the united states japan england and hong kong his recent books include when reason goes on holiday philosophers in politics encounter books 2016 and making sense of heritability cambridge university press 2005 he has also published a number of articles in leading philosophy journals follow him on twitter nsesardic one cannot properly judge this new multiple version of the sokal affair before studying the fake articles that were part of the project conducted by lindsay boghossian and pluckrose among all these submitted papers mixing “absurdities and morally fashionable political ideas” the project collaborators single out the article that was accepted by the journal hypatia a journal of feminist philosophy as their most important success indeed kudos to them yet the reader should know that it is a carefully guarded secret in philosophy that feminist philosophy is often not characterized by intellectual rigor and high academic standards the secret is so wellguarded though that many philosophers do not dare to admit even to themselves to know it let alone express it publicly so hypatia was a logical and easy choice for the attempt to place a fake paper in one of the wellknown philosophy journals occasionally however unintentional absurdities of feminist thinking have crept into much better philosophical journals than hypatia a good example is an article from the australasian journal of philosophy in which a feminist describes a “phallic drama” involving two statements p and p the negation of p there is really only one actor p and p is merely its receptacle in the representation of the venn diagram p penetrates a passive undifferentiated universal other which is speciﬁed as a lack which offers no resistance and whose behavior it controls completely note that this is no longer a sokaltype hoax but an instance of authentic feminist philosophy sometimes it is impossible to tell the difference for more information about how caving in to feminism damages philosophy as a discipline see the 2014 article coauthored by rafael de clercq and me at the beginning of the text in which the three collaborators explain their project they write “because of the politicized nature of these disciplines it bears mentioning that all three of us would be best classified as leftleaning liberals” sokal himself also found it important to stress while explaining his hoax that he was a man of the left i am puzzled by this if you are criticizing a trend that clearly belongs to the political left why should you feel it necessary or useful to say that you are yourself leftist isn’t it enough that you offered arguments in support of your criticism which presumably should speak for themselves what’s the point of making that additional step and showing your political colors hoping to placate those you criticize by signaling that you are actually one of “them” or making clear that you should not be associated with the “right wing” to which you honest do not belong anyway i was in a similar situation in 1981 when i wrote my first article in a series of criticisms of marxism in what was then yugoslavia a friend of mine slightly worried about me and possible consequences of publishing that article advised me to add one sentence and say that despite attacking marxism i at least supported socialism i refused to do that not only because i was not a socialist but primarily because i thought that the question whether i was a socialist or not was entirely irrelevant for my article besides even if i had been a socialist i would still have been against publicly subscribing to socialism on such occasions for although in this way it might have been somewhat easier for me to attack marxism the widespread practice of declaring one’s political views might have made the discussion more difficult for those who were not socialists and who had political opinions that were widely and more strongly condemned the same applies to the current situation of the dominance of the left in western universities leftists criticizing the left should not hurry to identify themselves as leftists while making that criticism first because this information is irrelevant and second because this could put pressure on conservatives to come out of the closet which for obvious reasons many of them might be reluctant to do or alternatively under the circumstances their conservatism could be inferred from their silence about their politics the grievance university — jonathan anomaly philosophy politics and economics jonathan anomaly is a faculty fellow at the institute for practical ethics at ucsd a founding faculty member of the philosophy politics economics program at usd and will be a visiting scholar at oxford university in winter 2019 his current research focuses on the moral and legal dimensions of synthetic biology including gene editing and the use of synthetic phage viruses to combat antibioticresistant bacteria more generally he writes about the relative role of social norms and legal institutions in solving different kinds of collective action problems anomaly is coauthor of philosophy politics and economics oxford university press 2015 his publications can be found here and he can be contacted at anomalyucsdedu the authors have pulled off a modern sokal hoax the sequel is rarely as good as the original but in this case it was more comprehensive and more fun than sokal’s mockery of postmodernist scholarship a computergenerated version of which can be found here the project exposes some of the cultish ideas shared by faculty who have created fake subjects and staffed their departments with political activists many faculty in these departments seem alarmingly eager to hijack for their own ends the emotional circuitry of teenagers who arrive on campus in search of a tribe to join and a dragon to slay if this were the extent of the problem we could laugh it off as a strange new sport that occurs on college quads rather than in football stadiums but it is much worse than this the main problem is not the rise of trendy disciplines with names that end with the word “studies” or the opportunity cost of spending taxpayer money on bogus scholarship and bad education rather than medical research and space exploration the problem is that many students are required to take these classes as part of a “diversity” requirement at universities and that when students graduate these ideas influence leaders of corporations like google which can manipulate its search engine to alter elections and change our epistemic environment in subtle ways to take an example many students in universities and employees at google take bias training courses that tell them “white privilege” and “systemic racism” explain disparities in outcomes between groups despite the fact that—to take one example—asian americans from china and india ‘people of color’ make more money and are incarcerated at lower rates than whites according to the conspiratorial worldview of many faculty in grievance studies departments citing statistics and making arguments that go against the privilege narrative proves that you have an unconscious bias against minorities and that you’re probably a white supremacist boghossian lindsay and pluckrose did not publish their articles in the top journals of core fields like economics or psychology so some skeptics might dismiss the project as a waste of time but their articles did pass peer review in journals from fields whose basic assumptions are shared by mainstream subjects like literature sociology and increasingly philosophy some of the most insidious dogmas many faculty in these fields defend include the idea that evolutionary biology can explain animal behavior but isn’t relevant to people that differences in personality and intelligence can only be explained by education and parenting not genes that iq tests don’t predict anything useful that differences in outcomes for different groups can only be explained by oppression or systemic racismsexism and that five decades of behavioral genetics research can be safely ignored when it threatens environmental explanations these are the dangers of our time it is worth reminding those who subsidize this circus that we’re not in las vegas what happens on campus doesn’t stay on campus

our name we are the sovereigns and only by our consent do our rulers rule it is not by our conformance to some ruling philosophy or creed that we the people are sovereign no divine law or prophesy compelled the framers to write the constitution as they did or us the people to ratify it if a religion whether traditional or untraditional compelled any individual that has no bearing within the constitution while in our various ways we believe that the supreme reality will have the last word no one standing on such ultimate authority has constitutional power any different than any other citizen before that supreme reality we are all on equal ground for better or for worse this is a nation for which we are responsible because our constitution and our government results from our own choices we have no excuse to slough off the responsibility for how it turns out therefore with no compulsion from without we join together on the basis of equality and choose to yield certain of our powers to those we choose though elections give us the power to review and change our government we truly entrust the exercise of some of our own sovereign power to those we together with our fellow citizens choose for better or for worse we are connected to our fellow citizensovereigns whether that citizen is a fool or a genius kind or insensitive intelligent or boorish that citizen has exactly the same status as every other – one vote one share of the national sovereignty therefore to have a coherent country we must communicate with our fellows persuade them where the common good lies through our words and our actions and most of all our example to try to evade the need to communicate by requiring others to think speak and act only in a way they define is a stark betrayal of this most basic building block of our republic — we the people to fight racial bias by being biased doesn’t work to protest unthinking and illegal brutality and violence by using unthinking and illegal brutality and violence doesn’t work either to persuade people that they are incapable of accepting responsibility for their own communities their own families and their own lives betrays democracy and

encroachment we don’t need to conform to any favored philosophy or curry favor with any power to be equal under the law and the constitution the power given us in our unalienable rights is a power to take up responsibility rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin it has become strangely popular to think that the job of the state is to relieve citizens of their responsibility one should be responsible only to the state the state in turn will fight your battles for you it will make it so that you need not take any responsibility up at all — they will take complete care of your health your safety your money they will take care of your responsibility to think they will do all these things for you they say things that only they are competent to do accept your incompetence release your responsibilities and let everything be done for you we the people know that to release our responsibilities is to release our liberties we the people know that everyone in the state is no more and no less than just another one of the people and that any power they have beyond that has been given by us we are competent as the people to remove such people from special power we must do so whenever they use their power to decrease ours we must do so whenever they preach the incompetence of the people incompetent people make incompetent government powerless people make a government powerless to do anything of worth as conservatives we know we have been given the power to be competent involved and responsible citizens we know that we have been given all we need to have a republic if only we choose to keep it we know that our prime responsibility as citizens is to help each other citizen realize their own competence and power we know that our responsibility is not primarily towards the abstraction of a government but towards each and every individual for in their prosperity and success all will succeed we give our political loyalty to those who understand that it is the

twitter wants to editorialize and factcheck president trump’s tweets with disclaimers then it should be treated like any other publisher twitter’s decision this week to append a disclaimer to president trump’s tweets about the risks of mailin ballot fraud should be enough at long last for us to dispense with the fiction that twitter is nothing more than a neutral platform it’s not it never has been and it’s time to stop pretending otherwise set aside the relative merits of trump’s comments and the entire debate about whether mass voting by mail is a good idea because that’s not what’s important here by stepping in to flag trump’s tweet with a warning label and a link so users can “get the facts” about mailin ballots which ironically links to a cnn article by chris cillizza twitter abandoned any claim it had to being a neutral facilitator it crossed over in other words from being a supposedly unbiased social media platform to being a traditional publisher—in this case a publisher with a very clear editorial position this has been true for some time now everyone knows that silicon valley is politically progressive and as vox reported wednesday its top executives are working hard to elect presumptive democratic nominee joe biden the only difference now is that twitter decided to make it bonecrushingly obvious social media companies like twitter facebook and google have been censoring and editorializing for years under the absurd pretext that they were just enforcing their own “community guidelines” not weighing in on the merits of what their users were saying or embedding their own biases into the site’s rules who writes and enforces these community guidelines people like yoel roth twitter’s head of site integrity whose antitrump tweets from 2016 and 2017 resurfaced recently roth called trump and his officials “actual nazis” compared senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to a “bag of farts” and implied that trump supporters are racists this person is the “head of site integrity” at twitter pictwittercomhyzcl5vie0 — jon levine levinejonathan may 27 2020 what changed this week is that twitter essentially came out and admitted these biases discarding the façade of a neutral platform the company itself it turns out has a point of view—in this case about absentee voting—and it is willing to push that point of view on its users not just by employing people like roth to write and enforce its rules but by explicitly factchecking the president of the united states by doing this twitter hasn’t just waded into politics in an overt way it has exposed the fiction at the heart of what social media companies are they’re not neutral platforms they’re biased and like their peer organizations in the mainstream media they’re overwhelmingly biased against conservatives and in favor of progressives twitter needs to be held to the same standards as traditional publishers here’s why that’s a big deal for decades social media companies have wanted to have it both ways they wanted to be able to enjoy liability protections that traditional publishers don’t have while censoring opinions they don’t like and promoting those they do they’ve been able to do this in part thanks to federal law back in the late 1990s when the internet was young congress exempted internet companies from liability for publishing things that were inaccurate or potentially libelous so long as they were uploaded by a third party specifically section 230 of the communications decency act passed in 1996 protects companies like twitter from being sued for allowing users to post crazy conspiracy theories malicious lies and outright falsehoods that’s why for example you’ll occasionally see completely false news stories on twitter like this one from december 2017 in which cnn claimed donald trump jr had been tipped off about hacked wikileaks documents before they were made public exclusive donald trump trump jr and others in the trump organization got an email in september 2016 offering a decryption key and link for hacked wikileaks documents httpstcohejlhtiykm pictwittercomdccmnhtzge — cnn cnn december 8 2017 contra cnn there was no story here at all trump jr had simply gotten an email from someone telling him about wikileaks documents that had already been released cnn chalked it up to an honest mistake all of this to say twitter facebook google and other tech giants with massive social media platforms obviously have an editorial slant much like the new york times or the washington post or cnn unlike those outlets however these tech firms have been able to hide behind the canard that they’re just providing a space for third parties to exchange ideas so they can’t be held liable for what their users post no more if twitter wants to start factchecking everything that gets posted by influential people fine but there’s no way it can do so in an evenhanded or fair manner and no way it can continue to insist on section 230 protections as missouri sen josh hawley said wednesday “it’s pretty simple if twitter and google and the rest are going to editorialize and censor and act like traditional publishers they should be treated like traditional publishers and stop receiving the special carve out from the federal government in section 230” hawley has the right instincts here at the very least he and his republican colleagues in the senate should call on twitter ceo jack dorsey to explain why his company should continue to enjoy section 230 protections when it has clearly decided to act like a traditional publisher while he’s at it maybe dorsey can explain what he meant when he told sam harris last year “i don’t believe that we can afford to take a neutral stance anymore” then again maybe he doesn’t need to we all know what he meant

is because the network has been in the tank for biden for over a year they dragged their feet on many stories related to him including him lying on being arrested in apartheid south africa on his way to meeting nelson mandela chariton told fox news outlets like cnn are protectors of the status quo and as such they will always try and cover up bad stories for candidates like biden rather than cover and challenge him this isnt the first time cnns onair coverage has raised eyebrows on thursday cnn bizarrely spent over 100 minutes covering president trumps refusal to wear a mask at the ford plant meanwhile the network spent just 15 minutes combined from monday through thursday covering the growing nursinghome controversy plaguing democrat new york gov andrew cuomo cnns chris cuomo does prop comedy with ny gov andrew cuomo fails to ask about nursinghome controversy a cnn insider told fox news that while trump should have worn the mask the network is putting an undue emphasis on whats not important i dont know why they focus on things like this when there are certainly more important things to focus on the network source said the insider knocked cnn suggesting that if trump found the cure for the coronavirus without wearing a mask him not wearing the mask would become the story on the network cuomo has largely gotten a pass from cnn as the network has largely refrained from airing critical coverage of the democrat governor on wednesday he appeared for his 10th interview with his brother cuomo prime time anchor chris cuomo as in previous interviews the cnn anchor made no mention of the growing death toll in new york nursing homes yet he did manage to squeeze in some prop comedy mocking the governors televised coronavirus test examination with overlysized cotton swabs while poking fun at the size of his nose cnns jake tapper called out for hypocrisy after scolding trump for launching smear campaign against rivals cnns coverage of andrew cuomo has been consistent with much of the media focus on the glowing verbiage and ignore the catastrophic mishandling of nursing homes that led to thousands of deaths” cornell law school professor and media critic william a jacobson told fox news “this problem is compounded by a serious conflict of interest arising from the relationship between chris cuomo one of cnns highestprofile news personalities and his brother the governor” jacobson added “chris cuomo should not be allowed to cover or comment on air about his brother and cnn should appoint someone to monitor and review coverage of andrew cuomo to prevent this conflict of interest from bleeding over to other news coverage” fox news senior meteorologist janice dean told tucker carlson tonight thursday that cuomos failed nursinghome policy should be one of the biggest stories of the year after both of her parentsinlaw lost their lives to the coronavirus i have not seen the coverage of this an emotional dean said twenty percent of our lost loved ones are from nursing homes because governor cuomo and several other governors forced covidrecovering patients into nursing homes click here for complete coronavirus coverage dean who rarely comments on political issues felt compelled to speak out after watching wednesday nights cnn interview between the two playful cuomo brothers the fact that i am seeing last night him making fun inappropriate jokes and insensitive jokes cruel jokes make no mistake dean said i am glad that chris cuomo has recovered from covid because he apparently did have it and im glad that their family is well but my

thomson the brutal hatefilled slaughter of 50 muslims in mosques in new zealand garnered worldwide news coverage for days as the outrage was real and visceral but the reaction belies a broader issue that is generally buried for illfitting the narrative muslims are not only extraordinarily safe in the united states they are thriving first it’s worth noting what some conservative sites have pointed out while the world was rightly indignant over the new zealand killings the world and media seemed largely indifferent to the slaughter of three times that many christians in one africa country in a threeweek period or the 23 christians killed by the fulani or the ongoing killing of christians for being christians around the globe — particularly by extremist muslims here is an extensive example of that from the new american that is all true christianity is the most persecuted religion worldwide pretty much all agencies agree on that there just isn’t much outrage as it is largely islamist extremists doing the killing islamists kill even more fellow muslims but there is another element to the difference in the coverage in new zealand and in africa and some ears will not want to hear this killing people particularly over religion or ideology is wildly unacceptable in christian and postchristian countries in the west it is far more accepted as just part of life in many other cultures particularly islamic countries a lot of violent death can and does create a hardened acceptance dutiful disclaimer islamists slaughtering the “wrong” kind of muslims along with any christians and nonmuslims readily available to be killed are not the majority of muslims in the west and particularly in the united states violent muslim extremists are a very very small minority — perhaps the lowest in the world but in some countries from the palestinian territories stretching through syria iraq iran afghanistan pakistan saudi arabia yemen and back to egypt and libya extremists and islamists are very sizable minorities by their own selfprofessed opinions so in those countries where attacks against civilians are accepted by between 8 percent and 20 percent of the population and between 90 percent and 100 percent of the population is muslim the violence is more common and more accepted if not actually desired that is not the case in the united states or new zealand or other western christian or postchristian countries and it is far more rare despite all the blather about the rise of islamophobia in the united states more mass attacks are carried out by islamists in the name of islam than against muslims far more further the united states is one of the safest countries perhaps the absolute safest country in the world to be muslim and practice islam like us on facebook in a report that came out last september by the tony blair institute for global change tracking the roots spread and effects of violent islamist extremism researchers found that 121 terrorist groups sharing portions of an ideological form of islam are now operating around the globe their deadly actions in 2017 alone resulted in the deaths of 84000 people — about 22000 of them civilians — in 66 countries speaking to the council on foreign relations former british prime minister tony blair said in september that islamist extremism is “global and growing” adding that it “didn’t begin with al qaeda nor will it end with the defeat of isis” the “global extremist monitor” which was produced by blair’s nonprofit used hundreds of news sources that reported on incidents of violent extremism in 2017 according to a cbs news report from the time “there were a total of 7841 attacks – an average of 21 per day –in 48 countries it said with wartorn syria topping the list of countries most affected by violent extremism overall muslims were the most frequent victims of deadly attacks twentynine violent islamist groups were actively engaged in conflict in syria in 2017 the report said with isis responsible for 44 percent of all attacks half of all civilian fatalities recorded globally were documented in syria” in a national geographic article by a muslim who is an npr correspondent covering race and diversity politics are more than obvious we see that despite the best attempts to paint america as bigoted muslims that are not activists largely don’t think it is a big problem the article “how muslims often misunderstood are thriving in america” talked to a lot of muslims around the country here is a tidbit “that’s what musa loves about being muslim in america the rights of expression and worship are protected here he says he can choose to be the kind of person the kind of american the kind of muslim he wants to be he points to his shelves at his rustic home on a sheep farm they’re filled with books written by shiite and sunni scholars reflecting the many schools of thought under those two main islamic sects “this is the place to be a muslim scholarship without intervention” he says “in malaysia i could go to jail because i have shiite literature in my house and in malaysia that’s the equivalent of being a commie in america”” so despite the handwringing by the media democrats and some muslim activists such as cair the us is not only one of the safest countries in the world to be a muslim but muslims may also thrive here more than any other place when including overall freedoms and economic opportunities — all of which probably explains why the percentage of islamists among american muslims is so low rod thomson is an author host

iyac0z,2020-09-23 16:42:12,Republican,Senate Report Says Joe Biden Allowed Family to Enrich Themselves Abroad While He Was VP,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/09/23/senate-report-says-joe-biden-allowed-family-to-enrich-themselves-abroad-while-he-was-vp/,Curious447,806,189,a new senate report released wednesday concludes that former vice president joe biden allowed hunter biden and other members of his family to enrich themselves through links with foreign companies and governments while he was in office the report notes that the obama administration was aware of but did nothing about the conflict of interest that was created when joe biden’s son hunter biden was appointed to the board of burisma a corrupt ukrainian fossil fuel company but the report goes further than what was revealed during the impeachment inquiry last year it presents email evidence that former secretary of state john kerry whose stepson chris heinz was one of hunter biden’s business partners was also aware of the conflicts of interest it adds that “hunter biden his family and business partner devon archer received millions of dollars from foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds” it notes that hunter biden went on a “100000 global spending spree with james biden and sara biden” after receiving money from a chinese investor and it adds that hunter biden appeared to have paid women linked to an “eastern european prostitution or human trafficking ring” it also notes “the records acquired by the committees show consistent significant and extensive financial connections among and between hunter biden james biden sara biden devon archer and chinese nationals connected to the communist regime and people’s liberation army as well as other foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds” the report presented by by sen ron johnson rwi of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs and sen chuck grassley ria of the senate committee on finance was launched in august 2019 — prior to the impeachment controversy and as the result of the “henniges transaction” in which a company tied to the chinese state had bought an american company that makes “antivibration technologies with military applications” one of the companies in the transaction was bohai harvest rst bhr a chinesefunded investment company in which hunter biden owns a stake the report “details examples of extensive and complex financial transactions involving the bidens” and notes that hunter biden “was not the only biden who cashed in on joe biden’s vice presidency” it also notes that hunter biden enjoyed secret service protection during extensive trips abroad and that the protection continued for a few months after he joined burisma it concludes the records acquired by the committees show that hunter biden and his family were involved in a vast financial network that connected them to foreign nationals and foreign governments across the globe hunter biden and archer in particular formed significant and consistent financial relationships with the corrupt oligarch mykola zlochevsky during their time working for burisma and their firms made millions of dollars from that association while joe biden was vice president and the public face of the obama administration’s ukraine policy rosemont seneca thornton an investment firm cofounded by hunter biden received 35 million in a wire transfer from elena baturina who allegedly received illegal construction contracts from her husband the former mayor of moscow moreover archer’s apparent receipt of money for a car from kenges rakishev of kazakhstan while vice president biden was in kyiv is especially concerning in light of the timing and finally biden and archer’s work with chinese nationals connected to the communist regime illustrate the deep financial connections that accelerated while his father was vice president and continued after he left office the report also notes that the vice president was made aware of the conflicts of interest that hunter biden’s ukrainian role entailed as was secretary of state kerry former secretary kerry’s december 2019 denial of having any knowledge about hunter biden or burisma is inconsistent with the evidence uncovered by the committees kerry was briefed about hunter biden burisma and heinz the day after burisma announced hunter biden joined its board additionally secretary kerry’s senior advisor sent him press clips and articles relating to hunter biden’s board membership this appears to be yet another example of high ranking obama administration officials blatantly ignoring hunter biden’s association with burisma the reports written by the republican majority on both committees accuse democrats of falsely linking the investigations to foreign influence campaigns — ironically the report notes relying on foreign nationals with an interest in influencing us politics hunter biden spoke during the democratic national convention declaring that his father would be an “honest” president joel b pollak is senior editoratlarge at breitbart news

hstl61,2020-07-17 13:51:01,Republican,"GOP Congressman Chris Smith sanctioned by China for being pro-life, pro-Hong Kong",https://mercatornet.com/chinas-tit-for-tat-sanctions-against-us-human-rights-campaigners/64705/,IUSanaTaeyeon,811,43,as the international fallout over china’s oppression systematic discrimination and mass sterilization in the northwestern autonomous territory of xinjiang continues the united states has finally imposed sanctions on four senior chinese communist party officials who orchestrated systematic human rights abuses under the global magnitsky act the four include the man who turned xinjiang into an orwellian police state with a giant openair concentration camp ccp politburo member and xinjiang party chief chen quanguo along with three other ccp officials in retaliation china has taken “titfortat sanctions” against four american politicians and against the us aerospace and defense giant lockheed martin the politicians targeted by china are new jersey congressman chris smith senators ted cruz and marco rubio and us ambassador at large for international religious freedom sam brownback china has labelled all four “longterm enemies of china” “antichina politicians” and “troublemakers” diplomatic spat just the usual diplomatic spat between the us and china in fact anyone who takes the time to examine the actions taken will realize the vast difference between the two superpowers the simple fact is that the men the us sanctioned are allegedly little less than criminals by contrast the men china has sanctioned have consistently fought against oppression human trafficking china’s onechild policy and ongoing religious persecution the skewed vision of the chinese government can be seen by contrasting the human rights records of congressman chris smith and the “great old friend of the chinese people” – former us secretary of state henry kissinger who chinese leaders have fawned over for decades let’s begin with republican congressman smith for a start he has been the most consistent champion of the rights of the unborn and mothers of china in washington dc his entire congressional career has focused squarely on prolife and human rights causes around the world a prominent catholic smith was elected in 1981 just a year after china’s onechild policy was enacted by the mid1980s during the reagan years he was already championing the fight against china’s brutal and inhumane onechild policy smith was also one of the first american politicians to point to the pervasive role the united nations population fund and the unfpa played in directing china’s allout assault on life and birth freedom in 1985 representative smith drafted an amendment now known as the kempkasten amendment to the us foreign aid bill explicitly condemning china’s onechild policy it provided authority for president reagan to withhold funds from the unfpa it is important to note this was in the 1980s long before the full extent of the horrors of the onechild policy were revealed – a time when china was still viewed by the west as a beacon of hope for future reforms smith was already warning of the dark side of the ccp’s policy and moving to have american funding of the chinese state family planning commission restricted his amendment has been the main reason that american funding has been withheld from the unfpa smith has remained consistent in his unwavering fight for the prolife cause in china and elsewhere he has written many letters and resolutions and drawn up legislation aimed at curbing the onechild policy and the activities of the unfpachinese family planning commission two decades after the reagan administration smith successfully lobbied the bush administration to defund unfpa and redirect millions of dollars of funding in doing so he saved the lives of many thousands if not hundreds of thousands of chinese babies by repeatedly blocking and reducing the funding which would have flowed to the professional population control machines of china or other developing nations smith’s human rights track record but smith’s track record does not stop there he has helped and hosted dissidents human rights activists and victims of the onechild policy to speak out about their experiences in forums congressional hearings and interviews he has tirelessly called for the end of the onechild policy and after china’s twochild policy came into effect together with senator rubio he debunked the lie that birth control in china had been abolished he exposed the truth – that restrictions on births forced abortions and mass sterilizations were continuing under the socalled “twochild policy” during then chinese president hu jintao’s state visit to the united states in 2011 smith also questioned hu about forced abortions and when he in turn visited china he attempted to visit the detained dissident and human rights activist chen guangcheng who had exposed the cruelty and scale of the implementation of the population control policy in the northern chinese province of shandong he later played a key role in facilitating chen’s 2012 escape to the united states in the same year smith highlighted in a congressional hearing on china the case of feng jianmei a chinese woman who was forced to have an abortion seven months into her pregnancy after she could not pay a hefty fine for exceeding the birth limit this is one of many congressional hearings smith has held or attended highlighting the crimes of china’s population programme many of these crimes would never have come to light in the west had he and his colleagues not intervened as ccp oppression in hong kong and xinjiang has become the focus of world attention in recent times smith as the chair of the congressional executive committee on china has championed their causes and sponsored legislation like the hong kong human rights and democracy act and the uyghur human rights and policy act he tirelessly advocated for the freedom of the uyghurs hong kongers and victims of china’s population control policy long before these causes attracted popular support smith’s fight against population control tyranny is not limited to china he has been the single most consistent prolife advocate in the united states congress against global population control and has repeatedly called for the us to stop having any role in funding the unfpa and restrict participation in un meetings and conferences on population he has also held us congressional hearings on highlighting the abuses of the peruvian population control programme’s mass forced sterilisations of the 1990s sexselective abortions in india and provided leadership on the reinstatement of the mexico city policy which blocks us federal funding for abortion providing ngos worldwide it is important to note here that smith’s crusades against the onechild policy and population control have not been motivated by an “antichina” sentiment had china heeded his calls for the end of the onechild policy millions of lives could have been saved he respects the sanctity of life and has been remarkably consistent in defending it and kissinger compare smith’s record with that of henry kissinger who continues to visit china always receiving a warm welcome while beijing has permanently blocked smith from entering the country kissinger who orchestrated the sinoamerican rapprochement of the 1970s and organized the visit of richard nixon to china is promoted as a “wise old sage” his role in global population control and china’s onechild policy in 1974 he directed the drafting of nssm200 also called “the kissinger report” a memorandum in which the us government identifies the growth of population in third world countries as a national security threat in response to this “threat” in 1975 kissinger and president gerald ford made it official us government policy to support and fund population control programmes worldwide indoctrinate the youths of developing countries with antinatalist propaganda and encourage leaders of third world countries to start population control programmes in their respective nations this paved the way for us government policy to fund support and use the unfpa international planned parenthood foundation and the governments of developing countries to carry out its agenda of global population control in this respect henry kissinger is the architect of global population control and directly contributed to the founding of china’s onechild policy so what can we conclude from all of this well from now on congressman smith and the other three us politicians should consider the sanctions they have received from beijing as a badge of honour they are not the enemies of china or the chinese people but defenders of the rights of the chinese people what congressman smith really deserves is not a sanction but a “thank you” from the chinese people for his efforts over the decades to highlight the abuse they suffered under the ccp’s onechild policy

ja2eow,2020-10-13 02:50:27,Republican,Members of black Delaware church don’t recall Biden being ‘raised’ there,https://nypost.com/2020/10/12/members-of-black-delaware-church-dont-recall-biden-being-raised-there/,Beliavsky,802,79,more campaign trail claims from democratic nominee joe biden have been called into question — this time his tales of being “raised” in a black church in delaware where he was supposedly a civil rights organizer the former veep 77 has repeatedly spoken about participating in the civil rights movement as a teenager in the 1960s and of attending organizing sessions at the union baptist church in wilmington — then run by the rev otis herring an acclaimed pastor who died in 1996 but congregants and a longtime assistant to herring at the prominent black church told the washington free beacon this week that they never remembered biden attending as he claimed and said he met herring as an adult when asked if biden attended union baptist phyllis drummond herring’s longtime assistant who attended the church for four decades said “no not at our building” juanita matthew another longtime member told the free beacon that she also wasn’t aware of biden’s attendance as a high school student she said herring only befriended biden after the newly elected senator’s wife and daughter were killed in a tragic car accident in 1972 but called the lawmaker “a great friend of the church and the pastor” in various stump speeches during the democratic primary biden repeatedly claimed he was at union baptist every weekend and was involved in organizing antisegregation protests “when i was a teenager in delaware for real i got involved in the civil rights movement” biden told a crowd of parishioners at the bethlehem baptist church in south carolina on jan 20 “i’d go to 8 o’clock mass then i’d go to reverend herring’s church where we’d meet in order to organize and figure where we were going to go whether we were going to desegregate the rialto movie theater or what we were going to do” he went on “i got my education for real in the black church and that’s not hyperbole it’s a fact” he said at an naacp event in iowa several days prior biden said his “political identity” was shaped by his experiences at the church “i was raised in the black church politically — not a joke” he told the audience according to the new york times “that’s what i’m part of that’s where my political identity comes from and it’s the single most loyal constituency i’ve ever had” he said in january civil rights activist shaun king accused biden of being a “serial liar” and said he had spoken to “former members” and people close to herring’s family who said the claims were untrue “four different people in wilmington expressed to me that these claims of biden are so outrageous and dishonest that it caused them to truly worry for his mental health” king wrote in his brutal takedown biden’s white house run has been beset by gaffes and fabrications including his claim that he was arrested in south africa in the 1970s during a trip to visit antiapartheid leader nelson mandela he walked back these comments when it was revealed they weren’t true he also claimed that he called serbian leader slobodan milosevic a “damn war criminal” to his face during a 1993 meeting but people in attendance said they couldn’t recall such an exchange critics of the former vice president also accused him of taking the support of african american democratic voters for granted after he infamously said any of them who vote for president trump “ain’t black” biden’s 1988 presidential run was also undone by a plagiarism scandal and claims that he participated in civil rights marches — something he later admitted was false “during the ’60s i was in fact very concerned about the civil rights movement” he said during a 1987 press conference where he admitted “i was not an activist” the thendelaware senator said his exposure to the civil rights fight actually came from working at an “allblack swimming pool” in wilmington “i was involved in what they were thinking what they were feeling but i was not out marching” he said according to an archived new york times report “i was not down in not out marching i was not down in selma i was not anywhere else i was a suburbanite kid who got a dose of exposure to what was happening to black americans” he said the biden campaign could not be immediately reached for comment

passed a 19 billion disaster aid bill to the island that is still struggling after the september 2017 hurricane severely damaged the islands infrastructure and power grid weirdly enough trump sort of called this in april when he went on a minitwitter rant accusing democratic lawmakers of playing games with a funding bill puerto rico politicians are incompetent or corrupt he tweeted adding their government can’t do anything right the place is a mess – nothing works fema the military worked emergency miracles but politicians like the crazed and incompetent mayor of san juan have done such a poor job of bringing the island back to health the democrats today killed a bill that would have provided great relief to farmers and yet more money to puerto rico despite the fact that puerto rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any “place” in history the people of puerto rico — donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 2 2019 are great but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt puerto rico got far more money than texas florida combined yet their government can’t do anything right the place is a mess nothing works fema the military worked emergency miracles but politicians like — donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 2 2019 the crazed and incompetent mayor of san juan have done such a poor job of bringing the island back to health 91 billion dollars to puerto rico and now the dems want to give them more taking dollars away from our farmers and so many others disgraceful — donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 2 2019 trump was savaged at the time by politicos journalists and commentators for suggesting puerto rico suffered in the aftermath of hurricane maria from the same sort of government corruption that exacerbated new orleans following hurricane katrina “donald trump’s liefilled rage tweets … continue a trump pattern that mirrors a method that white supremacists have used throughout american history” the levelheaded charles blow theorized in his usually clunky and nearincomprehensible prose in the new york times “particularly present since reconstruction this method involves proclaiming that minorities lack the character and capacity to create effective government and therefore minorityled jurisdictions are a hopeless drain on resources” sarah jones said elsewhere for new york magazine’s intelligencer “trump’s longstanding antipathy for people of color is germane to his rhetoric on puerto rico when he speaks you don’t have to strain to hear the undertones for what they are stereotypes that depict poor people of color as moochers takers and welfare queens have been around a long time and they’ve informed immigration and welfare reform stances in both major parties at various points in their histories “the argument that immigrants are violent job thieves stems from this source and so too do trump’s falsehoods about puerto rico” she added the washington post’s philip bump wrote trump has repeatedly complained that the funding going to the island was being wasted or spent to pay down that debt without evidence trump always saw puerto rico’s government as questionable and wasteful and then apparently seized on that idea to rationalize his arguments that the island was receiving too much money bump added surely they will all print followups acknowledging the oversight admitting that the president and his allies were correct about puerto rican relief efforts being stymied by corrupt local officials any minute now

are the oldest men ever to run for president of the united states especially given president trump’s recent covid infection and the former vice president’s frequent mental lapses voters should be paying close attention to their running mates they had an opportunity to do just that during the first and only vice presidential debate held in salt lake city when vice president mike pence squared off against sen kamala harris dcalif joe biden’s secondincommand after the raucous and disappointing headtohead between trump and biden a week earlier the vp contest came off as infinitely more civilized but at times equally frustrating to viewers in particular it was annoying that harris dodged significant questions like whether she and biden agree with democrats calling to pack the supreme court like biden she simply refuses to answer the question an important one to voters cal thomas why trumps covid experience could completely change the trajectory of the 2020 campaign in fairness both candidates were evasive at times but pence has been in the public eye longer than his rival we have a good idea where he stands on most questions while harris has skittered back and forth on issues like the green new deal “medicareforall” and law and order bending with the politics of the moment we know pence we do not know harris 2020 trump supporters looked to pence to provide the defense of his administration that the president failed to offer up in his debate against biden they were not disappointed pence was solid as a rock and though he started tentatively got more powerful and convincing as the night wore on pence looked presidential in spite of a fly which inopportunely landed on his head for several minutes the same could not be said for harris she constantly smirked and frowned and shook her head in derision while listening to pence no wonder democrat primary voters decreed her “unlikeable” democrats want this election to be a referendum on trump’s personality since their party is significantly divided biden and harris studiously avoid issues since with each declaration they risk alienating some in their own camp also disagreeable were the stale democratic party talking points harris dished up attacking president trump she landed a few good punches but the night belonged to vice president pence his job was easier he can boast of the trump administration’s threeyear record of achievement including extraordinary job creation and income gains for all americans kamala harris can talk up biden’s 47 years of what exactly surviving democrats want this election to be a referendum on trump’s personality since their party is significantly divided biden and harris studiously avoid issues since with each declaration they risk alienating some in their own camp jimmy failla trump is on pace to win 2020 election in a lawnslide heres why i say that hence they are running mainly on denigrating trump as we saw during their interminable and unpleasant convention harris’ most effective attack was directed at the white house’s handling of covid19 which she called the “greatest failure of any presidential administration in american history” looking into the camera she told viewers “the president and vice president knew on jan 28 what was happening and they didn’t tell you” she also attacked the white house’s suit seeking to dismantle obamacare which she claimed would deny people coverage who have preexisting conditions this is a central theme for democrats trying to undermine the confirmation of judge amy coney barrett to the supreme court and it doubtless alarms a great many americans asked whether she would take a vaccine when one becomes available harris responded that if dr anthony fauci recommended it she would take it but she would not do so on the advice of president trump she and other democrats have made such comments before intimating that trump is cooking up a vaccine in his garage and that it can’t be trusted doug schoen harris and pence at vp debate — winners losers and more on style and substance pence rightly called her out on sowing distrust in a future cure warning that she could cost many people their lives by doing so harris reiterated her ticket’s promise to repeal trump’s tax cuts while arguing that taxes would go up only on people making more than 400000 per year both cannot be true click here to get the opinion newsletter mike pence pointed out that the average family of four had saved 2000 per year in taxes because of those cuts and that because of wage hikes that same family saw their income rise by 4000 last year he could have also added that even leftleaning groups like the tax policy center acknowledge that biden’s plan to raise taxes by 4 trillion during a recession would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive down incomes for all american workers including those in the lowest income quintile as pence said “the american economy is on the ballot” he is correct not surprisingly the economy was the strongest arena for pence he applauded trump’s renegotiation of trade deals and most specifically nafta he chided harris for being one of only 10 senators to vote against usmca as the new deal with canada and mexico is called he also attacked the bidenharris 2 trillion version of the green new deal and their intention to reenter the paris climate accord warning that both would hurt the economy pence accused harris and biden of promising to end fracking which is controversial in critical swing state pennsylvania she denied the charge but numerous clips prove pence correct harris claimed that trump “lost the trade war with china” pence was incredulous and said “lost the trade war with china joe biden never fought it” pence missed a few obvious opportunities like celebrating trump’s historic peace efforts in the middle east but he scored many others such as castigating democrats for not joining in passing sen tim scott’s rsc police reform bill he noted that harris had walked out of the room when scott presented his proposals – not a good look for someone who supports black lives matter click here to get the fox news app

j656aj,2020-10-06 16:37:19,Republican,Letter Calls for Withdrawal of ‘1619 Project’ Pulitzer,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/letter-calls-for-withdrawal-of-1619-project-pulitzer/,AshamedDepartment,784,97,nikole hannah jones the daily show with trevor noah via youtube an open letter released today and signed by 21 scholars and public writers calls on the pulitzer prize board to rescind the prize for commentary awarded to nikole hannahjones for her lead essay in “the 1619 project” the letter is posted at the website of the national association of scholars here i am one of the signatories advertisement the letter revisits the sorry tale of the 1619 project’s errors and distortions and invokes these in calling for the revocation of the prize the recent revelations that the new york times stealthily edited out the signature claim of the project—that the advent of slavery in the year 1619 constitutes our country’s “true founding”—were however the immediate occasion for this letter as phillip magness another signatory has shown nikole hannahjones has several times denied ever claiming that 1619 was our true founding although in fact she has made this latter claim repeatedly these actions on the part of both the times and hannahjones are profoundly irresponsible and disturbing how can we explain them jonah goldberg has suggested that the times may have undertaken its stealth edits “out of a partisan desire to deny donald trump and his fans a talking point” there is some evidence in support of this suggestion as wilfred mcclay another signatory notes in commentary magazine leaked transcripts of internal meetings at the times suggest that the 1619 project may have been part of a strategy designed to help elect a democratic president by highlighting america’s allegedly endemic racism not long after president trump effectively made american history a campaign issue in his mt rushmore address this july hannahjones began to deny that she or the 1619 project had ever asserted that the year 1619 was america’s “true founding” citing the stealthily edited text of the project as evidence see especially the exchange with ben shapiro here the hannahjones interview on cnn that helped kick off the controversy over the stealth edits took place the day after president trump attacked the 1619 project in his address to the white house conference on american history this suggests that hannahjones was willing to jettison the most notable claim of her project—even to the extent of denying that she had ever made it—once that claim began to seem like a campaign liability advertisement when however were the stealth edits to the 1619 project’s text actually made phillip magness suggests that at least some of the stealth edits may have been made as early as december 2019 at a moment when the 1619 project was coming under withering criticism from scholars that alone may or may not suffice to explain the stealth edits it is notable however that hannahjones continued to claim that 1619 was america’s true founding until shortly after that claim became an issue in the presidential campaign moreover while there is some evidence that stealth edits may have been made as early as december of 2019 we do not know for a fact exactly how many edits were made when they were made or why they were made this itself constitutes the most serious sort of journalistic irresponsibility advertisement imagine that a pulitzer prize for literature had been awarded to a novel for which it later emerged that the most famous passage had been plagiarized at that point the prize would rightly be revoked now imagine that a pulitzer prize for literature had been awarded to a novel whose author after receiving the prize surreptitiously edited out the most famous passage from the ebook and denied repeatedly that the passage had ever been in the novel to begin with in that case the prize would not be revoked but the author would be considered to have gone at least semimad advertisement what do we say then about a pulitzer prize for journalism where the publisher edits out the most famous passageclaim and the author repeatedly denies that the claim had ever been there to begin with although she herself made the claim repeatedly in a variety of public contexts well after publication of the original text what do we say when the author points to the stealthily edited text as proof that the claim edited out was never actually made to begin with despite the fact that she herself repeatedly made the claim for months on end advertisement if the most talked about claim of the 1619 project a claim cited in the prize itself can simply be disowned and then the fact of the disowning lied about it cannot ever have been seriously meant to begin with it was laid down in bad faith at least some significant part of the motivation for these deceptions and prevarications appears to be political and if we cannot investigate this in greater detail that is because the times has hidden its own postpublication editorial actions the height of journalistic irresponsibility to my mind this is the moral equivalent of discovering a plagiarized passage in a novel after a prize has been awarded it’s one thing to know that the 1619 project had a partisan political aspect that would not by itself invalidate the prize so long as the claim being made was serious and seriously meant for substantive reasons but to casually make a gigantic claim—a claim cited in the prize itself—then simply toss it away and cover up the fact of having done so turns a core reason for the prize into a joke by striking the most famous claim of the 1619 project and then covering up that act the times and hannahjones have retroactively exposed their effort as a badfaith project in an important sense they have delegitimized the central claim for which they received the prize to begin with just as surely as they would have done by surreptitiously stealing that passage from another author advertisement in short the pulitzer prize board should revoke its award to nikole hannahjones

via email informed me that i probably rode the short bus to school in my early years and that everyone would be better served if i just went away well i’m here to tell you that trump is even closer to winning reelection now than he was at the end of last year i am not alone in this observation the cook political report’s amy walter is seeing the playing field much the same way i am heading into 2020 trump’s primary strengths remain incumbency — since 1900 nearly 80 percent of incumbent presidents have been reelected — and the economy since fdr every incumbent president “who has avoided a recession in the leadup to an election year was reelected” a trade truce or deal with china will most likely ensure a recession does not occur before next november advertisement contrarians point to national polls and the slew of battleground state surveys including florida and argue trump is losing “bigly” to a handful of candidates and is therefore toast the situation is certainly not ideal for trump but early polling from previous presidential tilts suggests the media and antitrump forces are getting way ahead of themselves who can forget that in june of 1983 eventual democratic nominee walter mondale was leading president ronald regan by 10 points or that in june of 2011 a generic republican presidential candidate was leading president obama by 5 points unless something totally unforeseen happens such as a major military conflict the global economy tanks a thomas eagleton situation grips the democratic party trump becomes ill etc this is going to be a close race — the country is just that evenly divided and thus the race will likely be decided by just a handful of states florida north carolina arizona iowa pennsylvania wisconsin and michigan the biggest hurdle the trump reelect faces is that his disapproval rating has hovered above 50 percent for quite some time the democrats can thank their willing accomplices in the press big time for that so what does trump need to do to win reelection his team can start by taking a page out of the 2012 obama campaign playbook — and that is precisely what the trump campaign is doing as obama 2012 campaign aide ben labolt points out recent successful incumbent presidents prevailed “by executing a twoyear campaign to exploit a contentious primary on the other side reconnect with their base of supporters and define the election as a choice not a referendum” after all who can forget mitt romney willard mitt mitt romneysenate gop open to confirming yellen to be bidens treasury secretary overnight health care moderna

electoral strategy but since march the president has held numerous rallies in other key battleground states to remind his core supporters exactly what is at stake in 2020 given that trump is a dogged campaigner this will most certainly continue what has been eluding the trump campaign is how to best disqualify the 2020 democratic field before the party is able to officially select a nominee — but the campaign’s prayers may have been answered thanks to an assist from democrats themselves yes the democratic contenders have been on an insane race to the left in an effort to win over their primary voters from singlepayer health care and the elimination of private health insurance to free college and massive student loan debt forgiveness to letting imprisoned convicts vote there seems to be no

whatever reason should not be detained and just about all should get to stay indefinitely — complete with benefits from free health care to free education and maybe even free puppies by the time this campaign is over and when it comes to the taxpayer’s dime what voters are hearing is that illegal immigrants come first and certainly before americans citizens and the working class even new york

Life,https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/30/twitter-and-social-media-are-a-cancer-on-our-civic-life-they-dont-deserve-protection/,Foubar,769,115,the debate about whether social media companies should have protection from liability misses a larger question about their role in american society there’s nothing like a row between twitter and president trump to turn everyone into an expert on 47 us code § 230 a heretofore obscure section of federal law that deals with liability protections for companies like twitter go on social media right now and you’re bound to find friends neighbors and colleagues opining on federal statutes and citing old supreme court cases to bolster their arguments that we have to do this or that right now to save the internet or protect free speech so let me just say up front i am not an expert on section 230 or on federal liability law generally i don’t have a strong opinion on exactly how the law should be reformed or what the mechanisms of a successful reform might be nor do i think there aren’t real tradeoffs to consider here but i don’t need to be an expert in liability law to know this social media are corrosive to our civic life and social media companies like twitter are largely unaccountable for their actions in that regard without question twitter and facebook and youtube have harmed democratic life in america eroded our civic values and exacerbated divisions and distrust between citizens if they all disappeared tomorrow the country would be better off consider for a moment the disconnect between what social media promised us and what we actually got the big idea was that making everyone more connected virtually would bring us closer together in reality that a digital commons would increase empathy and build real community facebook’s mark zuckerberg made this sentiment a kind of mantra when he took his company public in 2012 he was clear about the social mission behind the enterprise “we are extending people’s capacity to build and maintain relationships” he wrote adding that “facebook exists to make the world more open and connected and not just to build a company” it hasn’t worked out that way or at least not quite in the way zuckerberg meant the world is undoubtedly more open and connected thanks to facebook and twitter but it is not more sanguine or tolerant or kind connectedness through social media has not made us more empathetic or willing to change our minds and it has not brought us closer together just the opposite in fact even setting aside the online ugliness of the 2016 election is there any conflict or tension in american society that isn’t made worse by social media sure there are rare exceptions—sometimes people do nice things for each other sometimes people use these platforms to reunite with long lost family members or friends but the dominant emotion of social media is anger the default tone is caustic and the overall effect is division delete the comment section obviously not everyone shares this view many people think the advent of the internet and the inventions of mass platforms like facebook and twitter meant we had to make concessions in federal law to enable these companies to host thirdparty content without the fear of defamation lawsuits over what their users might post for some background on how we got section 230 check out eugene volokh’s helpful primer at reason rolling back or reforming these liability protections isn’t so easy were told and besides such drastic reform might not even be necessary after all companies like twitter have no obligation under federal law to be neutral in how they police content posted on their platforms my friend david harsanyi makes this point at nro rightly noting that newspapers and magazines with online comment sections enjoy the same liability protections under section 230 that twitter does an outlet like the new york times is liable for what it publishes or commissions but not for what online commenters write “in the same way” writes harsanyi “if twitter ‘factchecks’ a user its opinion should be considered published material that is no longer protected from liability by offering one opinion twitter isn’t suddenly liable for the billions of other tweets that exist on its site or for the opinion held in the tweet to which it is responding” it’s a fair point but it misses a larger problem why should twitter or facebook or youtube be given liability protections at all why should it be the case that these companies can host all manner of content make a fortune and not be expected to bear responsibility for any of it section 230 of the communications decency act was passed in 1996 back when congress was grappling with new technology and trying to make the internet as open as possible harsanyi and others worry that if liability protections are taken away there would be a flood of lawsuits media companies might abandon open platforms altogether social media as we know it might cease to exist let’s hope so it wouldn’t be the end of the world—or even of free speech—if we went back to an internet without comment sections without twitter mobs and without aggressively politicized social media companies and anyway in all likelihood we wouldn’t go backward but forward new kinds of platforms and new methods of communications would emerge maybe a more diverse array of companies too somewhere along the way someone might even devise a social media platform that doesn’t incessantly turn us against one another and stoke division and civic unrest the future is uncertain but the present state of affairs is not let’s admit what we all know twitter and the other tech giants are a cancer on our body politick we owe them nothing certainly not special protection from liability let them figure out how to operate like the traditional publishers they have decided to be—and if they can’t let them die

findings from the department of homeland security dhs the activists falsely claimed that trump “urged americans to inject themselves with disinfectant” and “told people to drink bleach” to understand trump’s remarks it’s important to first understand the full context of what was said at the press briefing bill bryan under secretary for science and technology at dhs said at the press briefing “our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus both surfaces and in the air we’ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favorable to the virus” bryan talked about the halflife of the coronavirus on surfaces like door handles and stainless steel surfaces saying that when they “inject” uv rays into the mix along with high temperatures and increased humidity that the virus dies quickly “the virus does not survive as well in droplets of saliva and that’s important because a lot of testing being done is not necessarily being done number one with the covid19 virus and number two in saliva or respiratory fluids” bryan continued “and thirdly the virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions” halflife of sarscov2 in saliva droplets virus does not last long in high temperature humidity sunlight pictwittercomettru48ite — ryan maue ryanmaue april 23 2020 bryan continued by noting that dhs also tested if certain types of disinfectant could kill the coronavirus “we’ve tested bleach we’ve tested isopropyl alcohol on the virus specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids and i can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes” bryan said “isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds and that’s with no manipulation no rubbing just bring it on and leaving it go you rub it and it goes away even faster” bryan added “we’re also looking at other disinfectants specifically looking at the covid19 virus in saliva” immediately following these remarks trump said so i’m going to ask bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of if you’re totally into that world which i find to be very interesting so supposing when we hit the body with a tremendous whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light and i think you said that hasn’t been checked but you’re going to test it and then i said supposing you brought the light inside the body which you can do either through the skin or in some other way and i think you said you’re going to test that too sounds interesting and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute one minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so it’d be interesting to check that so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with but it sounds interesting to me so we’ll see but the whole concept of the light the way it kills it in one minute that’s pretty powerful a few moments later abc news reporter jon karl asked bryan “the president mentioned the idea of a cleaner bleach and isopropyl alcohol emerging there’s no scenario where that could be injected into a person is there” “no i’m here to talk about the finds that we had in the study” bryan responded “we don’t do that within that lab at our labs” trump then clarified his remarks “it wouldn’t be through injections you’re talking about almost a cleaning and sterilization of an area maybe it works maybe it doesn’t work but it certainly has a big affect if it’s on a stationary object” trump later raised the possibility of whether uv rays could kill the coronavirus if it was on a person’s skin in particular if it were on their hands “if they’re outside right and their hands are exposed to the sun will that kill it as though it were a piece of metal or something else” trump asked “i don’t want to say it will at the same rate because it’s a nonporous surface but what we do know is that we looked at the worst case scenario and the virus lives longer on nonporous surfaces” bryan responded “so porous surfaces it doesn’t live quite as long so in theory what you said is correct” leftwing activist chris d jackson wrote that trump had “urged americans to inject themselves with disinfectant” tonight the far left seems more upset about a report suggesting a former treasury secretary is advising joebiden on economic policy than the fact that

police officer on memorial day was a horrific crime that understandably outraged americans of every race but tragically demands by some to defund or disband police departments around the nation will only lead to increased crime and the loss of more innocent lives including black lives already serious crime is skyrocketing in a number of cities as criminals take advantage of attacks on police to step up their activity from june 29 to july 5 there were 85 shooting incidents and 27 murders in chicago alone with most occurring on the city’s predominantly african american south side over the 28day period ending july 5 there were 388 shootings in chicago citywide — an increase of 76 percent compared to the same period in 2019 — and 95 murders ben shapiro all black lives lost should matter to black lives matter movement over the july fourth holiday weekend 44 people were shot in new york city and at least eight were killed in atlanta there were 31 confirmed shooting victims and five deaths over the holiday weekend including an 8yearold girl named secoreia turner she was killed while riding in a car with her mother by a “group of armed individuals who had blocked the entrance” to a parking lot police said many of the victims of these and other shootings are black every day police officers in communities across america willingly risk their lives to prevent such crimes without regard to the race or ethnicity of crime victims when the number of police on the streets is reduced — a consequence of defunding or the even more absurd abolition of police departments — it’s inevitable that more black and other lives will be lost as a result of increased crime the national black lives matter organization has led the way in demanding a “national defunding of police” the movement for black lives another wellfunded national blm group is demanding “a shift from massive spending on police that don’t keep us safe to a massive investment in a shared vision of community safety that actually works” although many of the national blm organizations have refused to lay out a timeline for defunding police departments some local groups have been more aggressive in philadelphia blm representative yahné ndgo has said that activists want a complete abolition of police in the city over just a fiveyear period blm isn’t alone in its calls for defunding police farleft politicians have also joined the effort including selfdescribed socialist alexandria ocasiocortez dny who complained in late june that action by new york city to cut its police budget by 1 billion — onesixth of the total — didn’t go nearly far enough “defunding police means defunding police” ocasiocortez said in a statement “it does not mean budget tricks or funny math it does not mean moving school police officers from the nypd budget to the department of education’s budget so the exact same police remain in schools” but radical black lives matter groups — many of which have explicitly endorsed socialism — and socialist politicians like aoc are doing the exact opposite of what needs to be done to protect black lives if they really believe black lives matter they would be seeking increased funding to put more police on the street can police training and policies be improved to reduce deaths at the hands of police yes can police do a better job removing officers who resort to violence without justification from their ranks of course why don’t the black lives lost to gangs and other criminals matter as much as the black lives lost to the relatively rare cases of unjustified killings by police reforming and improving the police is a laudable goal but defunding and dismantling police departments will only make things worse and result in the deaths of more crime victims should we defund schools because some teachers have raped and assaulted their students should we defund hospitals because some doctors have killed patients through medical malpractice should we shut down churches because there are documented cases of pedophile priests and other clergy members attacking children of course not defunding police makes no more sense why don’t the black lives lost to gangs and other criminals matter as much as the black lives lost to the relatively rare cases of unjustified killings by police and how do black lives matter activists plan to keep communities safe with smaller police forces when many of these communities aren’t safe now blm organizers have suggested that police pose such an incredible danger to black families that cities would be better off without them but nearly four times more people were killed by criminals in one week june 29 to july 5 in chicago alone than the number of unarmed black people who have been shot and killed by police thus far in 2020 in the entire united states – about seven all americans should stand firmly against police brutality racism and abuses and support reasonable reforms like ending noknock raids and requiring police to wear body cameras such reforms have been welcomed by many policymakers across the political spectrum and of course police who commit crimes should be treated like any other criminals — arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law but sending out unarmed social workers and psychologists to deal with rapidly unfolding and potentially dangerous situations won’t work armed robbers rapists violent gangs and other gunmen sometimes need to be confronted by armed police officers in many cases the deterrent effect or presence of police is enough to prevent violence but sometimes force becomes unavoidably necessary to save the lives of innocent crime victims imagine if your own child were in school and a gunman broke in and started shooting killing children and teachers would you want a social worker or armed officers to respond calls to defund police departments so that activists can expand failing welfare programs and hire an army of social workers aren’t just foolish such calls are incredibly dangerous and disrespectful to the families who have lost loved ones at the hands of criminals black lives matter leaders have argued that crime rates would go down if poverty were reduced they’re right reduced poverty rates are unquestionably associated with lower crime rates and where there is less crime there is less need for police but reduced crime is not the same thing as zero crime however it would be insane to slash police budgets to the bone prior to poverty rates falling and even more insane to think — as black lives matters claims — that simply increasing funding for welfare programs would magically reduce poverty click here to sign up for our opinion newsletter since the start of president lyndon johnson’s “war on poverty” more than 20 trillion has been spent on a long list of welfare programs but poverty rates have hardly improved at all similarly over the past two decades poverty rates among african americans have only decreased modestly despite trillions in government spending on poverty programs and much of the gains occurred only after the trump administration and the republicanled congress reduced regulations and cut taxes in 2017 and 2018 black communities have been suffering for far too long with higherthanaverage poverty and crime rates but neither problem will be fixed by abolishing the

focus on alleviating poverty through proven reforms like enhancing school choice investing in job training reforming welfare programs and helping police departments become more effective while also holding them accountable when they violate americans’ rights but none of these policies would move our country closer to socialism so the black lives matter leadership team — which is composed of numerous “trained marxists” — isn’t interested instead blm leaders argue it would be better to tear down as many existing american institutions as possible the police first among them regardless of

gyzsl7,2020-06-08 16:57:11,Republican,Is There Really an 'Epidemic' of Racist Police Shootings? Several Studies Say No.,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/matt-margolis/2020/06/07/is-there-really-an-epidemic-of-racist-police-shootings-several-studies-say-no-n484099,Foubar,754,166,the protests and riots that began in the wake of the death of george floyd show no signs of stopping anytime soon lots of wellintentioned people are expressing their outrage over what they believe to be an epidemic of racist police brutality perhaps the most common form of alleged racist police “brutality” we hear about is shootings particularly those with questionable justification to hear some people there’s an epidemic of racist police brutality and we need to do something about it black lives matter is calling on the defunding of police—which is just silly congressional democrats are looking to pass sweeping “police reform” and one can only wonder what their real objectives are but this all leads to some very important questions while we all agree that unjustified police brutality is bad is there really an “epidemic” of racial bias in police brutality it only takes one incident to go viral and serve as a call to arms for thousands of people to protest but is it a really as big of a problem as people suggest it is looking at the data the answer might actually be no according to a 2019 study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences white officers are not more likely to shoot black civilians than black or hispanic officers are according to the study there is “no evidence of antiblack or antihispanic disparities across shootings and white officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than nonwhite officers instead racespecific crime strongly predicts civilian race this suggests that increasing diversity among officers by itself is unlikely to reduce racial disparity in police shootings” other studies have reached similar conclusions including a harvard study that found no racial bias in police using deadly force though there is some disparity when it comes to physical force with regard to lethal force however no disparity exists “a solid body of evidence finds no structural bias in the criminaljustice system with regard to arrests prosecution or sentencing” explained heather mac donald of the manhatten institute in the wall street journal earlier this week “crime and suspect behavior not race determine most police actions” in 2019 police officers fatally shot 1004 people most of whom were armed or otherwise dangerous africanamericans were about a quarter of those killed by cops last year 235 a ratio that has remained stable since 2015 that share of black victims is less than what the black crime rate would predict since police shootings are a function of how often officers encounter armed and violent suspects in 2018 the latest year for which such data have been published africanamericans made up 53 of known homicide offenders in the us and commit about 60 of robberies though they are 13 of the population the police fatally shot nine unarmed blacks and 19 unarmed whites in 2019 according to a washington post database down from 38 and 32 respectively in 2015 the post defines “unarmed” broadly to include such cases as a suspect in newark nj who had a loaded handgun in his car during a police chase in 2018 there were 7407 black homicide victims assuming a comparable number of victims last year those nine unarmed black victims of police shootings represent 01 of all africanamericans killed in 2019 by contrast a police officer is 18½ times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer “however sickening the video of floyd’s arrest it isn’t representative of the 375 million annual contacts that police officers have with civilians” she said mac donald also noted that “a 2015 justice department analysis of the philadelphia police department found that white police officers were less likely than black or hispanic officers to shoot unarmed black suspects” mac donald has been writing about this subject for a long time in a 2016 piece called “the myth of the racist cop” she pointed out that police officers “are secondguessing their own justified use of force for fear of being labeled racist and losing their jobs if not their freedom” on oct 5 a female officer in chicago was beaten unconscious by a suspect in a car crash who repeatedly bashed her face into the concrete and tore out chunks of her hair she refrained from using her gun she said because she didn’t want to become the next viral video in the black lives matter narrative the chicago police department now wants to institutionalize such dangerous secondguessing its proposed guidelines for using force would require cops to consider the “impact that even a reasonable use of force may have on those who observe” it the following breakdown from law enforcement today also puts the issue of police brutality in perspective according to 2019 data there are 328 240 469 people here in the united states according to stats from com there are 670279 full time police officers here in the united states out of a total of 900000 sworn law enforcement officers data from national law enforcement memorial fund there are approximately 21 police officers per thousand people police officers are less than 21 of population officers come into contact with 17 of the population annually that means 55800880 contacts which at the time of the last report led to 26000 excessive force complaints against officers that’s 0047 of contacts only 8 of those complaints were sustained that’s 2080 out of 53380000 contacts or 0039 a good friend of mine who is a chief of police put that into perspective you are seven times more likely to be murdered … 15 times more likely to be killed in a traffic accident … 42 times more likely to be raped … … than to have a police officer use excessive force on you simply put the narrative that police officers are overwhelmingly racist is simply not true and has likely contributed to police being assaulted or killed during the rise of the black lives matter movement barack obama perpetuated the myth of systemic police racism described by some as a “war on cops” resulting in a spike of cops killed in the line of duty—a spike that ended during trump’s first year in office in fact the number of cops killed in the line of duty went up annually from 20132016 so cooler heads must prevail when it comes to this issue cops who use excessive force must be dealt with appropriately but perpetuating the myth of a widespread epidemic of racist cops helps no one and likely does more damage we literally have people calling for the defunding of police while there may be a few bad cops out there we rely on them to protect our communities matt margolis is the author of trumping obama how president trump saved us from barack obama’s legacy and the bestselling book the worst president in history the

reaction after the fbi determined bubba wallace was not the target of a hate crime 110 the fbi has determined that nascar driver bubba wallace was not the victim of a hate crime and that a pull rope fashioned like a noose had been on a garage door at talladega superspeedway since as early as october nascar said tuesday the fbi report concludes and photographic evidence confirms that the garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose had been positioned there since as early as last fall nascar said in its statement this was obviously well before the 43 teams arrival and garage assignment we appreciate the fbis quick and thorough investigation and are thankful to learn that this was not an intentional racist act against bubba we remain steadfast in our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all who love racing while angered at those saying it was all a hoax and that nascar overreacted wallace said tuesday night that nascar did nothing wrong in its handling of the situation when his team alerted nascar to what it found i stand by steve phelps nascars president wallace told cnns don lemon i stand by nascar the reaction to tuesdays fbi announcement by some is what angered wallace who said he had spent plenty of time reading things on his phone this will not break me none of the allegations of being a hoax will break me or tear me down wallace told cnn will it piss me off absolutely but that only fuels the competitive drive in me to shut everybody up wallace said he has read people saying it was simply a garage pull with a knot in it but he stressed that nascar and the fbi stated it was a noose it was a noose that whether tied in 2019 or whatever it was a noose wallace said it wasnt directed at me but somebody tied a noose thats what im saying it is a noose play 208 wilbon glad fbi determined bubba wallace was not victim of hate crime michael wilbon reacts to the fbis assessment that bubba wallace was not the victim of a hate crime when a pull rope fashioned like a noose was found in his garage at talladega sunday wallace nascars only black fulltime driver successfully pushed the stock car series to ban the confederate flag at its venues less than two weeks ago us attorney jay town and fbi special agent in charge johnnie sharp jr said their investigation determined that although the noose is now known to have been in garage number 4 in 2019 nobody could have known mr wallace would be assigned to garage number 4 last week the agencies said no crime was committed and the evidence did not support federal charges for us in nascar this is the best result we could hope for phelps said during a teleconference tuesday this is disturbing to hear that it was thought that one of our own had committed this heinous act it is fantastic to hear from the fbi definitively that there was not a hate crime phelps said nascar would continue its investigation as to why a rope was fashioned into a noose regardless of when it was done i do want to make sure everyone understands that if given the evidence that we had was delivered to us on late saturday afternoon we would do the same thing phelps said we would have done the same investigation it was important for us to do there is no place in our sport for this type of racism or hatred its not part of who we are as a sport a crew member for richard petty motorsports discovered the noose sunday at the alabama racetrack nascar was alerted and contacted the fbi which sent 15 agents to the track to investigate i want to be clear about the 43 team the 43 team had nothing to do with this phelps said the evidence is very clear that the noose that was in that garage had been in the garage previously the last race we had there in october that noose was present wood brothers racing said one of its employees informed the team that he recalled seeing a tied handle in the garage pull down rope from last fall when nascar raced at talladega in october the team said it immediately alerted nascar and assisted the investigation we are thankful for the swift and thorough investigation by nascar and all of the authorities involved richard petty motorsports said in a statement posted to twitter we are also appreciative of the support from nascar the motorsports industry and our fans the discovery of the noose stunned the stock car series as it is taking an active position in a push for inclusion while distancing itself from its rocky racial history the series first tried to ban the confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order two weeks ago wallace renewed the call for a ban and nascar answered but has yet to detail how it will stop the display there has been criticism of the ban by some longtime fans and security had been stepped up for wallace a 26yearold alabama native who in the past month has worn a shirt over his firesuit that reads i cant breathe his car had a black lives matter paint scheme for a race in virginia talladega marked the first race amid the coronavirus pandemic at which fans were permitted 5000 were allowed to purchase tickets and some who were upset with the flag ban paraded past the

march down pit road as they pushed his no 43 to the front of the line in the moments before the race when the group reached the front line monday wallace climbed out of his car and wept this sport is changing wallace said after the race the prerace deal was probably one of the hardest things ive ever had to witness in my life from all the supporters from drivers to crew members everybody here the

openly disagreeing with their educators will have negative repercussions with only about 30 percent responding they do not withhold their views in the comments section of the survey where students have the option to weigh in on the topic after they’ve answered several offered various anecdotes among them • cu boulder “you should be inclusive of everyone’s views” “ok maybe abortion is bad” “no not like that” • western kentucky university i wrote a 19 page research paper on a christian prolife movement i was the only one in the class that when presenting my paper had a “surprise visitor” who was the teacher’s very liberal friend argue with me about their views … • notre dame i actually got yelled at by a professor for my views on gun control it wasn’t an argument or anything just plain onesided insulting • clemson when writing papers for gen ed classes absolutely i know a guy who chose to write a proborder wall argumentative essay for our super liberal professor and the prof just wrote “this whole paper is one big fallacy” and bombed him me i wrote about the evils of horse racing perfectly safe topic • ucsd not for fear of a bad grade but fear of being a social outcast • penn state “well i actually have some different thoughts on that” “shut up you racist sexist homophobic xenophobic piece of human garbage” • umass amherst weird how being forced to hide my libertarian views in class for years just sorta drove me underground and now i’m a hyperauthoritarian funny how that works • nc state why would i get myself killed to say i’m a libertarian in a philosophy class • auburn i have had grades affected when i didn’t withhold my views • university of louisville i am conservative i would be crucified i heard enough horror stories from friends and family to keep my mouth shut and avoid politics in class if at all possible • kansas state professor the day after the presidential election kicked two students wearing maga hats out of class i was appalled we’re all people if someone disagrees with you — love them anyways • mizzou i’m a conservative but my essays are very liberal • arizona state in my sociology class my professor asked us if we would give our child hormone blockers if they believed they were transgender that was the day’s lesson one guy said he would rather teach his daughter to love her body the way it is than change it she sat straight up said “so you would be a bad parent then what was your name again” then she went to type something on her computer not a good day for him i’m sure • oklahoma state suuuuper liberal government teacher who only showed robert reich documentaries wasn’t gonna speak my opinion around there • alabama took a honors english class freshman year and i didn’t know the topic of the class until it

science major he did not take the poll schemmel who earlier this year wrote an article for the college fix maintains a personal blog on it he chronicled his experience of receiving his first “c” grade at american in an interest groups and lobbying class during the spring semester because he contends his professor knew he is conservative and disagreed with his politics his complaints to the dean over the issue were ultimately not resolved in his favor “i feel like i am alone in that i am the only person willing to speak up” schemmel told the fix some rightofcenter activist groups on campuses

against the establishment media believes president donald trump won the 2020 presidential election in a landslide speaking on conservative commentator mark levin’s radio program tuesday wood claimed that all the alleged voter fraud he’s uncovered has him convinced that the incumbent president won over 400 electoral votes in the race “this election was a fraud donald trump won i believe clearly a 70 percentplus landslide election in the nation he probably won over 400 electoral votes” wood said “so we’re uncovering step by step the layers of the onion and we’re going to get to the truth and the truth is donald trump has been reelected by this country to serve as president for four more years the truth will come out” listen from the 2342 mark below ﻿ that’s a bold statement to make especially given the media’s disputed declaration that democrat presidential nominee joe biden won the 2020 race with 306 electoral votes wood remains confident nevertheless because he a legendary attorney with decades of experience genuinely believes the “election was stolen” “donald trump won by such a large margin that in the middle of the night they had to stop counting and you’ll see in key states they started bringing in ballots by the truckload all of them for biden many of them in these mailin ballots with little bubbles for you to circle over the person you selected all of them for badbiden with perfect circles” he continued “i believe upon examination you’re going to find those perfect circles were made by a computer this election was stolen but they got caught” but this isn’t some farflung conspiracy theory to wood — it’s the “truth” “the fundamental principle that apply in my practice of law is apply the principle of truth the good the bad and the ugly but the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth” he explained “america is going to learn the truth soon that donald trump won an overwhelming landslide probably historic victory that’s what everybody in the country felt that’s what the voters have felt that’s why you got ninety six mile caravans in arizona that’s why you’ve had millions go to rallies” amish ‘trump train’ becomes online wonder and james woods breaks down why it matters httpstcosivwfyrtjb — conservative news bizpacreview november 3 2020 take note of wood’s complaints about ballots suddenly showing up in the middle of the night and unnaturally tilting the election away from the president some analysts have claimed that prior to ballots suddenly showing up the president had been winning in states like michigan and georgia with a ranging lead meaning for example that in some counties he was up as much as 20 percent whereas in other counties he was up only as much as 5 percent as soon as the ballots began pouring in however biden allegedly began leading in every single county by the exact same percentage points now it seems virginia has issues too from the nyt data majority of vote count updates gave biden a lead of the

been uploaded in fayette county just south of atlanta” the associated press reported “the breakdown of the uncounted ballots was 1577 for trump 1128 for biden 43 for libertarian jo jorgensen and seven writeins sterling said” the first batch was discovered sunday speaking with atlanta station waga on monday georgia’s voting system manager gabriel sterling said the mistake wasn’t the result of a technical mishap calling the mistake “an amazing blunder” he specifically said the ballots weren’t uploaded from a ballotscanning machine’s memory card “it’s not an equipment issue it’s a person not executing their job properly this is the kind of situation that requires a change at the top of their management side” he added listen watch “this is why you do the audits” said gabrielsterling with

the two republican officials reversed their decision and the certification proceeded as normal “jenna ellis a senior legal adviser to the trump 2020 campaign told ‘fox news night’ on tuesday that the two republicans on michigan’s wayne county board of canvassers involved in a brief deadlock in the county’s election certification process faced threats and allegations of racism before they agreed to certify the ballots” fox news reported “their decision to side with their democrat colleagues was dramatic and viewed by conservatives on social media as a capitulation after a brutal twohour public pressure campaign ellis told shannon bream the host of the show that she received reports that these two board members correctly spotted discrepancies and she said the ballot counts in 71 of the county’s precincts do not match voter rolls” listen to ellis’s remarks below via fox news’ “fox news night“ wood has also received death threats though unlike the two republican officials in michigan

‘Hate’",https://issuesinsights.com/2020/06/26/the-facebook-ad-boycott-is-about-silencing-conservatives-not-stopping-hate/,Foubar,735,130,ii editorial in the latest twist on cancel culture major corporate advertisers are pulling ads from facebook as part of a stophateforprofit campaign launched last week by the antidefamation league but this campaign isn’t about stopping hate on wednesday goodby silverstein partners – which represents companies such as bmw fritolay pepsico and hp – said it’s joining what is supposed to be a monthlong facebook boycott in july “we are taking this action to protest the platform’s irresponsible propagation of hate speech racism and misleading voter information” the ad agency tweeted goodby joins the likes of the north face patagonia ben jerry’s eileen fisher eddie bauer magnolia pictures upwork higherring dashlane and talkspace in pledging to yank ads from facebook in july the antidefamation league teamed up with the naacp and lesserknown groups such as sleeping giants color of change free press and common sense to launch the boycott in response it says “to facebook’s long history of allowing racist violent and verifiably false content to run rampant on its platform” but it doesn’t take much investigative work to realize that this campaign is really about pressuring facebook to do more than it already is to block conservative speech in the press release announcing the boycott naacp president derrick johnson complains that facebook won’t take “significant steps to remove political propaganda from its platform” wait what’s racist or violent about political propaganda and who decides what makes certain political speech “propaganda” johnson also complains that facebook is “complacent in the spread of misinformation” doesn’t the left consider anything conservatives say to be “misinformation” facebook is also guilty the boycott group says of “protecting … voter suppression” dig a little deeper and you realize that “voter suppression” can mean anything from campaigns to mislead voters about when or where they should vote to completely legitimate claims that imposing an allmail voting system this november would create new opportunities for fraud next take a look at the groups organizing the campaign sleeping giants describes itself as “a campaign to make bigotry and sexism less profitable” its mission appears to be deplatforming conservatives the organization cheered for example when twitter announced that it was permanently banning british commentator katie hopkins who had a million followers on the platform and has been a columnist for the sun and the daily mail but whose views were apparently too controversial read conservative for twitter this is a platform mind you where the hashtag killtrump is perfectly ok color of change calls itself the nation’s largest online racial justice organization and has as one of its goals “dismantling rightwing … infrastructuresupport” and “challenging … antiprogressive trump administration and state policies” its president rashad robinson has come out in favor of defunding the police which he calls a “violent institution” common sense media is run by jim steyer who has close ties to hillary clinton and is the brother of environmental extremist tom steyer net neutrality advocacy group free press is also involved in the campaign which is supremely ironic given that its support for net neutrality is premised on “enabling anyone to share and access information of their choosing without interference” is it not aware that it’s specifically demanding that facebook disable and interfere with users’ ability to “share and access information of their choosing” the antidefamation league’s decision to attack facebook is also curious since twitter is rife with antisemitic language two years ago in fact the adl found at least 42 million antisemitic tweets over a 12month period just a few days ago the adl took fire for its weak response to antisemitic tweets from rapper ice cube about which it was able to muster only the term “disheartening” why does twitter get a free pass from these groups could it be because twitter has been aggressively attacking president donald trump and those who want limited government low taxes free markets free speech and the right to own a gun so this boycott is nothing more than a politically motivated attempt to silence nonleftist speech companies backing it should be ashamed of themselves not facebook — written by the ii editorial board we could use your help issues insights was founded

democrats as tim alberta recently reported a lot of black voters think the answer is no that may explain why the democrats are blocking the gop justice reform bill in the senate with black voters already discouraged democrats don’t want them to get the idea that republicans may have something to offer alberta’s reporting in politico is striking at the invitation of a local africanamerican politico he spent an afternoon with a bunch of middleclass black voters outside detroit he found they were disappointed in the democrats thought nothing much had changed for them during the obama presidency and expected trump to win even though they planned to vote for biden themselves democrats havent actually helped black communities as a woman named ursura moore observed “some people thought just because we had a black president he was going to make things better for black people — he was going to free black prisoners wipe out black debt that was just ignorance but the disappointment some of us felt with obama — more so with the democratic party —that was real and it hasn’t gone away so people start to wonder whether the outcome even matters they wonder whether they should bother voting at all” eric benjamin commented “biden’s a politician same as the rest of them same as trump but at least with trump you know where he stands” he said “if we were sitting here me and you and you’re pretending we’re friends but then behind my back you act like you don’t even know me that’s the worst i’d much rather you just tell me to my face that we’re not friends that’s trump i respect that the democrats always be acting like we’re friends” and most damningly sherry gaydagnogo said “we’re always the f help and i’m tired of being the help” she cried “don’t wait until it’s an election year until you’re in trouble to come to us and ask for help saving your a they always say it will be different after the next election but it never is and we’re sick of it” even activists like shaun king are noticing that “systemic racism” seems to happen mostly in democraticcontrolled cities and states “democrats from top to bottom are running the cities with the worst police brutality in america right now we voted for them” from recy taylor to breonna taylor plight of black women often forgotten when it comes to justice so now comes president donald trump — who’s already successfully pushed a criminaljustice reform package the first step act with kim kardashian and kanye west and already issued an executive order limiting police chokeholds and other abusive behavior that won praise even from van jones — and the democrats are terrified that he might deliver a major reform bill in congress before the election and they can’t have that better that nothing should happen than that black voters might see trump as performing where the democrats — even when they controlled the white house and had a supermajority in congress — never did lack of support for tim scotts bill in the words of black republican senator tim scott of south carolina they cannot allow this party to be seen as a party that reaches out to all communities in this nation” so scott’s bill can’t pass the bill would make lynching a federal crime it would also place stringent reporting requirements on socalled “noknock” raids and tie federal grants to the elimination of police chokeholds like the one that killed george floyd it would also use grants to encourage the use of police bodycams as washington post columnist mark thiessen put it if democrats cared about police reform they would have advanced tim scott’s bill he called the democrats’ move “shameful” and observed “if democrats cared about getting something done they would have allowed the senate to move forward and sought to amend scott’s bill on the floor there was plenty of basis for compromise scott’s legislation had already incorporated a number of democratic proposals” yeah it could do more — i’d favor an end to “qualified immunity” from lawsuits for police officers and other government officials but i very much doubt that would command a majority even among democrats and the democrats’ motives are not pure as scott notes theyre ”pure race politics at its worst” juneteenth changing local politics not just protests vital for racial progress and there’s more not only did the democrats block debate on the bill but scott has been subjected to racial slurs — sen dick durbin used the word ”token” to describe scott’s bill a racial code word that scott called out and democratsupporting callers to scotts office are subjecting him to racial slurs and threats and calling him a “sellout” that for pushing a revolutionary piece of reform legislation so do black lives matter to democrats not if there are

action condemning the students with ferocity and vindictiveness advertisement journalists went on the offensive cnn ran an article titled “teens in make america great again hats mocked a native american elder at the lincoln memorial” then later changed the headline to “teen in confrontation with native american says he was trying to diffuse the situation” anna merlan of jezebel tweeted out a request for covington catholic school yearbooks in what appeared to be an effort to identify and to possibly dox the students former cnn host reza aslan posted “honest question have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kids” with a photo of one of the covington students seen in the video the apparatchiks of the social justice left piled on to ensure that heads would roll the activist gathering site changeorg published a petition demanding several changes at covington catholic school including the termination of the principal clearly petrified by the avalanche of bad press the administrators at covington initially condemned the actions of their own students some of whom were said to face expulsion there were even reports that covington parents have received death threats unsurprisingly this entire incident has been egregiously mischaracterized to bash the catholic students who showed support for donald trump donald john trumpgeraldo rivera on trump sowing election result doubts enough is enough now murkowski trump should concede white house race scott atlas resigns as coronavirus adviser to trump more and to protect some left wing adult protestors from accountability for acting very poorly the mainstream media saw an opportunity to advance a narrative of “white privilege” boys disrespecting a native american elder for no reason other than a “dislike of others” they of course ran with it but that is not what really happened you should watch the full video of the incident the truth is that these high school students were harassed mocked and threatened leading up to the confrontation with philips who chose to get in their faces and pound his drum present before and after the entire exchange was a radical activist group called the black israelites they yelled all kinds of phrases at the covington students from “white people go back to europe” to “the biggest terrorist on the face of this earth is the pale faced man” to “come any closer and you gonna catch it” to “i hope you crackers are ready” to “you have a school shooter haircut” there were slurs all manners of hateful language and all directed at the covington students these are teenage boys who were being menaced by a group of adult men it was in that circumstance that philips clearly well aware of what was going on decided march into the crowd of covington students as the radical activist group of black israelites egged him on once again the mainstream media has utterly disgraced itself with its coverage of this incident they could not resist the opportunity to slam a group of teenage boys who match the preconceived notions of “white privilege” their support for donald trump made them de facto guilty in the eyes of many journalists before anything was said or done that these students were defamed with their lives possibly forever damaged for the transient satisfaction of reckless journalists is appalling there is much soul searching that needs to be done in newsrooms across the country there is also a bigger lesson to be drawn social media mobs are a growing cancer on this country those in newsrooms have an obligation not to carelessly dramatize such malignant efforts at the cost of personal destruction this affects all of us it does not matter who you are whether you are active online care about politics or keep to yourself social media mobs may come for you for your spouse or for your child they engage in a ritualistic destruction of online reputations even a trip to the lincoln memorial for high school students can turn into something catastrophic journalists must find it in themselves to be better than this especially those who have the power of large online platforms perhaps the only way we can change the current climate is to hold accountable those who play into the rage mobs and remind the rest of us that no matter who you are it is only a matter of time before the online vigilantes come for you too buck sexton bucksexton is the cohost of the show “rising” on hill tv

to see an authority figure at a gathering of socalled progressives peddle racism and declaring that all persons of one race are subhuman i thought we’d been scrubbing that toxic poison out of the body politic starting generations ago wasn’t that a part of progress didn’t we fight a war or two over this but racism is back with a vengeance and getting a full airing and embrace by democrats at universities that promulgate critical theory in everything including race black lives matter and antifa rioters are allin on critical race theory and how racism is embedded in the very cells of white people it’s one of the reasons why they rage beat up cops and try to set them and other peoples’ things on fire reparations you understand in critical theory every issue is torn down targeted and built back up into what leftists prefer here’s how encyclopedia brittanica defines it critical theory marxistinspired movement in social and political philosophyoriginally associated with the work of the frankfurt school drawing particularly on the thought of karl marx and sigmund freud critical theorists maintain that a primary goal of philosophy is to understand and to help overcome the social structures through which people are dominated and oppressed believing that science like other forms of knowledge has been used as an instrument of oppression they caution against a blind faith in scientific progress arguing that scientific knowledge must not be pursued as an end in itself without reference to the goal of human emancipation since the 1970s critical theory has been immensely influential in the study of history law literature and the social sciences activist democrats at the socalled progressive netroots nation a convention put on by blogger markos moulitsas got a heaping helping of hate at the convention which took place in august it featured minnesota attorney general keith ellison california ag xavier becerra secretaries of state and the usual browbeating by ilhan omar ayanna presley and others but one of the netroots nation convention speakers from 2016 and 2017 is currently getting a fresh look on twitter in a presentation ashleigh shackelford who currently goes by hunter ashleigh the speaker and “trainer” espoused all manner of racist thought before a progressive crowd a twitter user by the name of “conceptual james” noted that the speaker’s presentation materials were the distillation of critical theory on two posters but it wasn’t only what the speaker wrote that made her presentation so poisonous it was what she said that was jawdropping a video of a portion of shackelford’s lecture has resurfaced on social media recently leaving people aghast that the naked racism wasn’t challenged here’s how she started notice no one leaves the presentation after they’ve been called “not human” “demons” and “racists” but also note that the anticapitalist wants you to pay for the privilege all white people are racists so i put this up because i really want any white person in the room to know up front that this is what we’re dealing with that it’s not going to be this coddling of white tears and we’re not going to discuss “oh maybe some of us are going to work it out” no you’re always going to be racist actually so even when you’re on your path to trying to figure out how to be a better human being i believe that white people are born into not being human laughs like people of color and black folks being dehumanized that actually everyone is dehumanized unintelligible off white supremacy that y’all are born into a life to not be human and that’s what y’all are taught to do be demons laughs so in this particular way white people are all racists so i just want y’all to know that up front reaction was mixed on

Items",https://www.theroot.com/ohio-man-charged-with-fraud-after-allegedly-spending-mo-1845214864,ShottyPumpin,720,71,screenshot 13 wmaz by now the entire world has heard of a little thing called the black lives matter movement which exploded after the deaths of george floyd breonna taylor and countless others this year since floyd’s death in may the momentum of the movement against systemic racism in policing has been nonstop but where most people see an opportunity to force change and start a lasting national and worldwide conversation on institutional racism one man appears to have seen an opportunity for something else fraud now that man who reportedly founded a group called black lives matter of greater atlanta is facing federal charges after he allegedly spent donation money on nice clothes luxury hotels and a new house meanwhile the real atlanta black lives matter is standing up to say “nah we don’t know him” advertisement 13 wmaz reports that 32yearold tyree conyerspage who goes by the name of sir maejor page has been charged with one count of wire fraud and two counts of money laundering according to a criminal complaint filed in the us northern district of ohio from wmaz the charges according to the complaint stem from fraudulent use of donations received between may and sept 24 2020 according to the complaint back in april 2019 a witness tipped off the fbi that conyerspage may have been using the black lives matter of greater atlanta blmga nonprofit organization to make money more than a year later in june 2020 that same witness went back to the fbi showing that the blmga organization conyerspage founded a splinter group that was never recognized as a representative of the official atlanta black lives matter organization was receiving donations from it’s official facebook page the page which was registered with the social media company as a nonprofit was cleared to receive donations because of that even though conyerspage’s organization had lost its taxexempt status in 2019 according to the complaint the facebook page was linked to a bank account named “black lives matter of greater atlanta inc” that was opened in april 2018 and page was the only signatory on the account from april 2018 until may 2020 the complaint said the blmga bank account’s balance “ebbed and flowed” however it never had a balance that exceeded 5000 the beginning balance of the account as of may 2020 was negative 1242 then a month later in june the complaint said the blmga facebook page received more than 36000 in donations the month after in july it received another roughly 371000 in august it received another nearly 60000 all of which was transferred to from the facebook page to the account listed for page advertisement so what did conyerspage spend all of that money on water and snacks for protesters bail money for arrested protesters organization efforts black people suffering economic losses due to the pandemic according to the charges filed against him the answer is none of the above instead conyerspage must have thought blm stood for “ballin’ like a muhfucka” because a debit card linked to the blmga bank account indicates that more than 200000 in donation money was spent on dining out entertainment nice clothing furniture luxury hotels a home security system and a more than 112000 house in toledo ohio where he actually lives according to wtol the house in toledo belongs to an organization led by conyerspage called hi frequency ron goolsby a member of the organization and friend of conyerspage said the organization bought the house to shelter victims of domestic violence though he admitted that conyerspage sometimes stayed there in fact goolsby told the toledo blade that he expects charges to be dropped against conyerspage saying “this is all going to be cleared up for sure” but there’s a lot more that conyerspage has to answer for than a house purchased under dubious circumstances according to the new york times conyerspage posted photos on social media that showed him wearing tailored suits with cufflinks and ties that he bragged had cost 150 he also boasted about a luxury hotel room he was staying in “my room way up at the top” he posted “at the top top” all the while conyerspage was telling blmga’s followers that the money was going to the cause advertisement from the times the greater atlanta organization maintained an active presence on facebook sought donations through gofundme and cheered on the protesters “we’ve been blown away by the millions that are coming together to demand justice — for george floyd breonna taylor tony mcdade and countless others who’ve had their lives taken” said one of its posts in august mr page said in private messages that the donations it received were being used to finance the group’s activism federal investigators said none of the money was “used for personal items” mr page wrote in one of the messages “all movement related” advertisement black lives matter atlanta—a completely different organization that actually is what it says it is—was quick to let it be known that it has nothing to do with the conyerspage and his organization “this page is not affiliated with any national brand and we are not a nonprofit” blma posted to its facebook page monday wsbtv reports “this page is not affiliated with the page mentioned in the article below this page will never seek donations this is a grassroots collective movement to fight for justice for the disenfranchised and victims of police brutality” advertisement the national black lives matter organization also released the following statement to wsbtv “the recent and past behavior of tyree conyerspage also known as sir maejor page has continued to compromise the integrity of the black lives matter global network foundation supporters and allies our stance remains that mr page is not affiliated with black lives matter global network foundation”

China,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/time-for-the-us-to-declare-independence-from-china,Foubar,705,61,americans now know they can’t rely on china or even our allies to produce the goods we need during a pandemic that’s why it’s time for the united states government to do what it did during the cold war — pioneer a new approach to manufacturing one of the most frightening aspects of the coronavirus pandemic is the realization that the us is no longer selfsufficient and cannot produce enough of the most basic items needed to protect against and fight the virus from n95 face masks to ventilators to essential pharmaceuticals america is dependent on china now we watch as china threatens us shortages and uses such trade for geopolitical gain in italy and elsewhere this reliance on china has been a growing concern of the national security community for years as it watched us dependence on china grow in a range of areas from military equipment components to rare earth minerals while we could afford to ignore that uncomfortable recognition for a while today our shortterm critical needs make that impossible the problem with dealing with our dependence on chinese manufacturing is that we are stuck in a deadlock some political leaders have called for a gradual economic decoupling to mitigate the risk others argue that decoupling would impose too many costs on consumers and businesses in the meantime no matter how this debate plays out there is a meaningful change that america can begin to implement now that will not only cushion us against key dependencies but also provide a road map for reducing the most serious ones for good this is for america to lead in agile manufacturing agile manufacturing sometimes called manufacturing 40 or digital manufacturing involves implementing technology such as robots and more flexible processes that make it easier to quickly change factories from producing one good to another this allows the manufacturer to respond to demand quickly think of how ford motor company and tesla are now producing masks and ventilators except being able to do this easily and efficiently whenever there was a shortage of goods or other change in supply or demand investing in agile manufacturing would pay significant strategic and economic benefits for the us investments could be used immediately to support the shift of some manufacturing to a covid19 response it would enable a backup plan for any weaponized manufacturing power plays by china agile manufacturing would also help the us manufacturing sector by making jobs much more resilient instead of a town being dependent on one product or company if that product is no longer needed or that company goes bankrupt the factory could quickly be retooled to manufacture other goods there would also be consumer benefits since new goods could be produced as consumer tastes or technologies change finally there would be significant benefits for the technology aerospace and defense sectors since they require much faster updates for strategic reasons government agencies have individually called for more agile approaches last fall before the crisis broke senior fda official janet woodcock urged a shift to advanced manufacturing technologies to improve drug quality address shortages of medicines and accelerate timetomarket last week the air force acquisition chief will roper called for “digitized engineering” and highlighted an example from the 1950s when the century series of fighter planes produced six different jets in five years compared with the decades it took to produce the current f22 and f35 china is already strategically implementing agile manufacturing its “made in china 2025” plan identified “numerical control tools and robots” as a key investment domain even more worryingly china realized that germany is the leader in agile manufacturing and has acquired german companies such as kuka one of the most important german flexible manufacturing companies flexible manufacturing is not just a business school case of achieving efficiencies it is a strategic tool that offers a concrete way to set ourselves up better for national security in the future three specific measures could be a start first we need a strategic approach in which the us government maps strategic industries so that they could produce related components if needed a tiered system of categorization could identify plants that could be grouped by the speed at which they can change manufactured goods while legislation such as cifius effectively provides a “defensive mapping” of what we need to protect a proactive strategic mapping approach takes the offense and begins the process of shifting the us manufacturing industry second federal state and local governments must incentivize agile manufacturing through tax incentives and loan guarantees the government must remove disincentives such as contract requirements by the department of defense for dedicated tooling going further agencies should require that manufacturers have an ability to retool quickly to continue production if geopolitical actors threaten supply chains of strategic industries at the local level factory towns should not be subject to the fortunes of a single product they need to be able to adapt to changes in market supply and demand which is good for both the nation and local communities finally the private sector has a role too it should factor in flexible manufacturing as part of its initial investment assessments this makes sense from a competitive standpoint as it helps companies adapt to changing conditions the government as needed could provide relevant industries with threat assessments while organizations that cater to csuite executives could evaluate the costs and benefits of moving in this direction power and geostrategic influence depends as much on speed and agility as on any weapons system covid19 has shown us and the world america’s manufacturing weakness agile manufacturing is one way to become stronger in the long competition with china it could mean the difference between winning and losing nadia schadlow is a senior

“protestors” seeking justice for black people they are defacing and seeking to overturn monuments to the very historical leaders who fought and ended slavery former us presidents abraham lincoln and general ulysses s grant the republican party was formed in 1854 to abolish slavery by the 1850s lincoln was a rising leader of the national abolitionist movement and the new republican party in 1858 lincoln challenged the reelection of illinois democrat senator stephen douglas spawning the famous lincolndouglas debates douglas argued for “popular sovereignty” with each new state to decide the issue of slavery by popular vote lincoln argued against this expansion of slavery proclaiming “all men are created equal” as set forth in our declaration of independence douglas won the election but lincoln won the debate in 1860 lincoln ran for president nominated by the antislavery republicans winning in a fourway race even before his inauguration democrat southern states began to secede from the union creating the confederate states of america war began in april 1861 when confederate artillery fired on the us army at fort sumter south carolina the civil war involved southern democrats shooting and killing northern republicans and visa versa a much more partisan affair than currently recognized and remembered general robert e lee fought the north to a standstill in virginia trying to assault washington while defending the confederate capitol at richmond president lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation in 1862 freeing slaves across the south general grant led important victories along the mississippi from new orleans to vicksburg and very bloody battles in tennessee lincoln promoted grant to fight lee in virginia general sherman carried on the western campaign to burn down atlanta then famously burn old dixie down marching through georgia to the sea sherman then turned northward to burn through south and north carolina joining grant in virginia lee realized then he had no chance to win the war he surrendered to grant at appomattox courthouse in central virginia in april 1865 nearly one million americans died in the civil war after the war lincoln led his republicans to enact the 13th amendment abolishing slavery and the 14th amendment recognizing due process of law and equal protection under the law for all americans including blacks despite their civil war defeat southern democrats maintained their power over blacks for another 100 years with jim crow segregation imposed across the south democrats denied blacks the right to vote and denied black children equal education southern democrats founded the ku klux klan a democrat militia that militia burned crosses on black homes and lynched innocent blacks klan leaders were elected to congress often rising to senior positions such as long time senate majority leader robert byrd these democrat congressional leaders defended segregation before congress even as the civil rights movement rose in the 1950s to challenge democrat apartheid across the south the democrat south was part of president franklin roosevelt’s new deal coalition and even part of president kennedy’s coalition as texas senator lyndon johnson served as his vice president it was not until the 1950’s that republican president dwight eisenhower forced integration of schools in the south over the opposition of democrat governor george wallace and other democrats this history was why martin luther king first rose in the 1950s as a republican as blacks were part of the republican party base until the 1960s as late as 1964 democrats were filibustering the civil rights act following kennedy’s assassination in texas republican votes broke that filibuster and passed the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 overcoming divided democrats with the passage of this landmark legislation in the 1960’s blacks finally seemed to achieve legal equality but ironically it was at just that time that president lyndon johnson concocted the socalled “war on poverty” which seemed to return blacks and other minorities to a “plantation mentality” maximizing their dependency on government until the 1960’s black families had remained largely intact with families married mothers and fathers raising their children together but with the war on poverty many poor mothers effectively “married the government” which provided for their children the family role of black fathers was diminished with many black young men turning to lives of drugs and crime can joe biden a senator since 1972 collaborating with southern segregationists and these democrats be trusted with power in america again or will they follow biden’s lead to repeal the 2017 tax reform act which brought record low unemployment to blacks and other minorities biden’s nearly 4 trillion tax increase would crash the american economy into longterm poverty lewis uhler is the founder and chairman of

Wade",https://www.liveaction.org/news/planned-parenthood-debunked-thousands-abortion-die/,shibeKBVE,697,104,planned parenthood president leana wen is repeating the lie that thousands of women died every year prior to the legalization of abortion wen was in dallas speaking at the annual fundraiser for planned parenthood of greater texas when local media station wfaa asked her about the state of abortion in the nation “i am deeply concerned about the future of roe v wade” wen told wfaa “we face a real situation where roe could be overturned and we know what will happen which is that women will die thousands of women died every year prior preroe” unfortunately dr wen is not being truthful dr wen’s repetition of these false numbers is nothing short of fear mongering as a physician wen should be aware that the introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s dramatically decreased not only illegal abortionrelated deaths but maternal mortality rates overall wen who has admitted that abortion is at the “core” of what planned parenthood does very cunningly played this fabricated card to frighten lawmakers and the public so she can protect the one “service” responsible for padding the pockets of planned parenthood’s leadership team ﻿ the claim that thousands of women died before roe was invented in the years leading up to the 1973 roe v wade supreme court decision when proabortion men set on manipulating the public began the push for decriminalizing abortion they were the founders of naral — larry lader an autobiographer of planned parenthood founder margaret sanger and former abortionist bernard nathanson — along with now president betty friedan nathanson later renounced his proabortion stance and worked to expose the lies he and his colleagues told later revealing how they completely fabricated the numbers in an attempt to sway public opinion at a time when society and especially women opposed unfettered legalization and people like planned parenthood’s president are still repeating these wholly false numbers here’s the truth live action news has documented thoroughly numerous times how multiple abortion insiders — such as planned parenthood’s medical director mary calderone and planned parenthood’s former “special affiliate” the guttmacher institute named after former american eugenics society vp and former planned parenthood president alan f guttmacher and others — say the number of women who died from illegal abortion prior to roe was hundreds or less reports on the facts listed below can be viewed here 1950 over 300 deaths source guttmacher institute 1957 260 deaths source planned parenthood medical director mary s calderone 1964 264 deaths source department of health education and welfare 1964 247 deaths source statistician dr christopher tietze 1965 just under 200 deaths source guttmacher institute 1965 193 deaths source planned parenthood 1966 189 deaths source national center for health statistics reported by cdc 1972 39 deaths source centers for disease control cdc 1973 19 deaths source centers for disease control cdc planned parenthood’s own published report image below contradicts dr wen’s false claim but despite nathanson’s admission and the fact that wen’s number is clearly not factual the abortionfriendly media failed to challenge the new planned parenthood president read get the facts thousands of women weren’t dying from abortion before roe v wade the legalization of abortion did not miraculously make abortions safe cdc statistics reveal that in 1972 the year before roe while there were 39 deaths from illegal abortion there were also 24 deaths in the handful of states where abortion had been legalized then in 1973 the year the supreme court forced abortion on the nation the cdc reports 19 deaths from illegal abortions and 25 deaths from legal abortion in other words the year scotus ruled on abortion more women died from legal abortions than illegal ones illegal abortion deaths 1930 to 1979 updated graph credit live action news despite claims of being for women wen conveniently failed to mention how women continue to die from legal abortion many of their names can be seen at the end of the video below while wen tricks the media into focusing on preroe abortion deaths she ignores planned parenthood’s own involvement in postroe legal abortion deaths — like those of planned parenthood patients creeerwin sheppard and tonya reaves the painful 911 call from cree’s mother when she discovered her daughter’s lifeless body is absolutely heartwrenching listen as cree’s brother describes his family’s agony over her death from a legal first trimester abortion at planned parenthood in michigan ﻿ if wfaa and reporter jason whitely have any journalistic integrity they will immediately call planned parenthood out for wen’s lie and publish a correction planned parenthood which commits over 330000 abortions annually remains the largest abortion corporation in the nation

how much is stolen investigate this corrupt mess immediately” he said fox news reports that trump was apparently referring to cummings’ questioning of border officials in his role as chairman of the house oversight committee this month he yelled at acting homeland security chief kevin mcaleenan for saying the department was doing its “level best” when it comes to the humanitarian crisis at the border “what does that mean what does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces can’t take a shower come on man” cummings yelled “what’s that about none of us would have our children in that position they are human beings” well it turns out that his district in baltimore isn’t much better than how he described the conditions at the border detention centers and of course trump’s

swatteam raids at dawn against aging political factota like roger stone and paul manafort it was really very courteous of cnn to have been parked outside the homes of those hapless victims so that television audiences all across the country could all be edified by these exhibitions of the coercive arm of state power in action mr mueller could just have had one of his 17 obamaandhillary supporting prosecutors ring up the latest mark and ask him to pop down to headquarters but that would not have been as dramatic as expensive or as cruel all good things come to an end however and yesterday after 674 days the investigation of special counsel robert s mueller gman extraordinaire finally came to an end when he filed his longawaited report with the attorney general william barr as for what’s in the report i know exactly as much as you rachel maddow jim acosta anderson cooper and their brethren in the fourth estate that is nothing at all nor is it at all certain that we will ever know all that much that’s in the report since the law prohibits the dissemination of potentially damaging information about people who were investigated but not charged with a crime there are bound to be large sections of the report that will remain forever under lock and key especially now that james comey and andrew mccabe are not in the fbi to leak them all we really know at this point pertains not the the contents of the report per se but rather to the future action of the special counsel there will be no more indictments how that announcement must have stung the nevertrump fraternity here they were huddled around bill kristol’s twitter feed for the last twoplus years praying predicting posturing that very soon now any day in fact robert mueller would descend into their midst the deus ex machina through whose instrumentality they were to be delivered at long last from the nightmare of donald trump and his unacceptable record of robust economic growth hundreds of constitutionallyminded judicial appointments rising wages historically low unemployment a more rational and businessfriendly regulatory environment deeper ties with israel a revitalized military and serious attention to our immigration crisis and the growing threat of an increasing militant china yes it’s been a bad couple of years for the nevertrumpers and even though robert mueller has hung up his spurs their travails are not yet at an end mr mueller indicted a slew of individuals and three russian companies he extracted seven guilty pleas from various people close or formerly close to president trump from the shyster michael cohen at one time trump’s personal lawyer to michael flynn briefly the president’s national security adviser before he was set up by the fbi and ruined financially by theprocessisthepunishment legal fees the really splendid thing about mueller’s indictments though is that not one of them pertains to the ostensible subject of his investigation to wit possible collusion between the trump campaign and the russians to steal the 2016 election the question is however what comes next last may in these virtual pages writing about the efforts of devin nunes then chairman of the house intelligence committee to get to the bottom of the skullduggery that instigated the mueller investigation i wrote that ‘what is being exposed is the biggest political scandal in the history of the united states the effort by highly placed — exactly how highly placed we still do not know — members of one administration to mobilize the intelligence services and police power of the state to spy upon and destroy first the candidacy and then when that didn’t work the administration of a political rival’ john brennan james clapper james comey sally yates andrew mccabe peter strzok lisa page john mccain christopher steele glenn simpson and others did their best to undo the results of the 2016 election the mueller investigation was their notsosecret weapon upon which vast hopes rested it has unfortunately for them been increasingly clear for some time that robert mueller was coming up emptyhanded at least on the main task which was to unseat the president hence the newly energized efforts by rep jerrold nadler and others to construct an ‘insurance policy’ in the form of impeachable offenses that might be brought against the president should horrible dictu robert mueller’s efforts at decapitation fail as i wrote here a few weeks ago ‘no one not named bill kristol now thinks that mueller’s expensive longrunning entertainment will issue in any actionable charges against the president’ nevertheless nadler and his colleagues have opened a sweeping corruption probe in a desperate search for compromising tidbits from donald trump’s past business dealings that could plausibly form the basis for articles of impeachment it’s a fool’s errand that chapter is closed there may be a few backwards glances as the story moves forward but moving forward it is and not in a direction that the nevertrump fraternity and the antitrump coven in the media and the government will like here we are just a day after mueller pushed his report over the transom at main justice and we’re getting headlines like this ‘as russia collusion fades ukrainian plot to help clinton emerges” that story begins ‘we now have strong evidence that retired british spy christopher steele began his quest in what ultimately became the infamous russia collusion dossier with a series of conversations with top justice department official bruce ohr between december 2015 and february 2016 about securing evidence against manafort ‘we know the fbi set up shop in the us embassy in kiev to assist its ukraine–manafort inquiry while using steele as an informant at the start of its russia probe and we know clinton’s campaign was using a law firm to pay an opposition research firm for steele’s work in an effort to stop trump from winning the presidency at the same time steele was aiding the fbi’ uh oh and there is a lot more where this came from schadenfreude is an unlovely emotion one it behooves us to renounce especially in the midst of lent but i suspect we’ll be seeing a lot of it abroad in the coming weeks and months as the beady eyes of the fbi swivel away from donald trump onto those who have spent the last two and a half years trying to destroy him

support girl scouts too i was grateful to see the post in support of women regardless of who they are” even one of barretts critics saw no issue “as much as i dislike this particular woman and deplore the political hypocrisy that allowed her to be in such respected company gsusa is completely right to recognize her” the commenter wrote “well done it could not have been easy” on tuesday barrett was

barrett is not the first time the girl scouts has shown support for female figures in the political arena the girl scouts previously shared a huffington post article dating back to december 2013 in

j1zo37,2020-09-29 16:56:12,Republican,How ‘Systemic Liberalism’ Failed Public Education in America,https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/09/23/how-systemic-liberalism-failed-public-education-in-america,DanAdamsShow,639,180,liberalism and its big government underpinnings have become systemic in american culture and institutions with a profound impact on the nation in large part an increasingly biased media hollywood big tech and academia have driven the left’s rise in prominence freedom of thought tolerance and inclusion once foundational principles of liberalism have been replaced by social conditioning and disdain for and suppression of opposing views public education is a prime example impact of unionization in 1916 the american federation of teachers was established as an affiliate of the american federation of labor widely known now as the aflcio the organization was founded to improve teachers’ wages pensions and “academic freedom” similarly the national education association was founded in 1857 as the national teachers association established primarily to protect teachers’ rights and ensure that members were treated fairly it changed its name in 1870 after absorbing three smaller organizations the nea also pushes to increase education funding and to discourage merit pay from a legislative standpoint the organization is active in reforming laws designed to limit the growth of charter schools and discourage school voucher programs the nea’s stated mission is “to advocate for education professionals and to unite our members and the nation to fulfill the promise of public education to prepare every student to succeed in a diverse and interdependent world” but critics fault the teachers union for putting the interests of teachers in front of the needs of the students they teach in recent years the national education association came under criticism for what some perceive as protecting “bad” teachers and trying to change public perception and beliefs about homosexuality and about “white privilege” and “white fragility” in our communities this can be illustrated best by the nea’s recent support for both the new york times magazine’s version of history called the 1619 project and for the black lives matter movement coalitions to maximize impact over the past several years systemic liberalism has metastasized throughout the public education system by partnering with the new york times and radical advocacy groups such as the black lives matter global network foundation the nea and its liberal positions are indoctrinating our youth neaendorsed curriculum developed to “inform” and to “challenge students to reframe us history” will condition students to accept and normalize liberal social constructs such as white privilege and institutional racism as well as slanted and distorted views of american history the nea says it teamed with the times to distribute copies of the 1619 project to educators and activists around the country saying it would “help give us a deeper understanding of ‘systemic racism’ and its impact” the 1619 project—which contends that american history began with the introduction of slavery—was rolled out early this year in school districts in chicago washington dc and buffalo new york local school administrators decided to update k12 history curricula to include the material which argues reason reported that “the institution of slavery was so embedded in america’s dna that the country’s true founding could be said to have occurred in 1619 rather than in 1776” however many historians and other critics question the 1619 project’s accuracy and the closed process behind it others have taken issue with its ideological slant and argued that the content would be better suited for sociology classes than american history in recent days following months of criticism the times has deleted some parts of the 1619 project including the statement that america’s “true founding” occurred in 1619 in any case reinterpreting history to fit a new political and social mantra is destructive to understanding the roots and progress of america its successes and failures and the reasoning during the respective time periods that led to specific actions and results otherwise as we all know history has a way of repeating itself black lives matter movement further illustrating the influence of systemic liberalism in the classroom is integration of the “black lives matter at school” curriculum including the 1619 project into school districts across the united states encouraging young minds to identify and condemn racism social injustice and oppression is a noble and righteous pursuit however that’s not what’s happening at least two of the three black lives matter cofounders are selfproclaimed trained marxists patrisse cullors arguably the most visible cofounder is a vocal antiisrael and lbgt activist alicia garza another blm cofounder has praised convicted copkiller and wanted domestic terrorist joanne chesimard also known as assata shakur both cullors and garza have spoken unabashedly about how shakur was a major inspiration for their work when one examines black lives matter as an organization one discovers that it advocates principles that go far beyond simply raising awareness of racism social injustice and oppression as published on the black lives matter global network foundation’s website–until it and related groups made deletions in recent days—the organization’s core beliefs and principles include “disrupting the westernprescribed nuclear family structure” “ending statesanctioned violence” against blacks “liberating” blacks from “systematic targeting” and “eradicating ‘white supremacy’ forever” the blm organization’s founding ideology and beliefs particularly its position on disrupting the nuclear family run contrary to traditional societal norms in america and represent a distorted and slanted view of what’s happening in our country by integrating black lives matter’s lesson plans educational resources and political activism projects into their curricula liberal educators lend credibility to one of the most radically divisive movements in our country’s history worse this approach convinces the easily influenced minds of our children that america is inherently “racist and evil” with a sordid history of inhumanity it inspires our youth to rebel against the very ideals that made america an exceptional republic and the most successful and compassionate country in the history of humanity liberal advocacy poor test results major financial supporters of blackled organizations such as the ford foundation and george soros’ open society foundations have invested hundreds of millions to influence public perception and policy related to social and racial inequality in america today and throughout our country’s history through their participation in liberal ideologicallybased movements teachers in some public school systems indoctrinate our children with marxist beliefs and distorted views of american history and culture while liberal coalitions wage their indoctrination and socialconditioning campaigns on our children the academic performance of us students continues to decline for example the global test results of the 2019 program for international student assessment or pisa—which evaluates 15yearolds’ academic performance in reading math and science—showed american students lag behind their peers in europe and east asia the exam results comparing 600000 students across 79 countries placed the us about average in reading eighth overall and science 11th but below average 30th in math the nations that outperformed the united states included china singapore macao hong kong estonia canada finland and ireland the us performed about the same as the uk japan and australia it may be a stretch to say these results represent the culmination of over a halfcentury of systemic liberalism in our public education system however liberal indoctrination certainly isn’t helping to improve reading and math scores and maybe schools should focus on the facts before trying to reframe history although trillions of taxpayer dollars have been invested in improving the quality of k12 education in america dating back to the early 1960s it appears politics has trumped the academic needs of our children money is not the solution from teachers unions and school administrators to the liberal media big tech political advocacy groups and the billionaires who support them is it possible that indoctrination of our children with radical leftist views of racism in america has taken precedence over their academic needs us educators would do better to provide our children with math science and reading skills necessary to compete in a global economy and stick to the facts when it comes to teaching american history civics and culture recent protests of police brutality which attracted america’s youth have led to anarchy violence arson and death putting the academic needs of students ahead of the ideological and political interests of those we pay to teach them seems likely to reverse what has become a disturbing destructive trend

group’s advocacy for defunding police departments and addressed issues of crime violence and the wuhan coronavirus as they relate to black lives matter protests however the reactions to many of her posts were overwhelmingly negative with users complaining about vague and tonedeaf answers to basic questions finances was one particular focus of scales’ critics black lives matter has been the recipient of millions of dollars in the past few weeks as a string of corporations and celebrities announced massive donations for her organization to establish social justice bona fides for themselves “obviously right now blm is getting millions and millions of dollars in donations” asked one reddit user “where is all the money going and how is it allocated” “yeah i would love to see a report about the amount of donations and for what it was used without this the organization only uses the blm name tag to get donations” another said in the ensuing discussion thread scales ignored these messages but eventually answered a question on the same topic it did not go over well “when people give money to black lives matter where specifically does it go” one user asked “what’s financial transparency like for your organization” scales gave a terse generic reply “hi — great question right now our programs are focused on civic engagement expansion of chapters arts culture organizing and digital advocacy resources and tools” she said “please visit our website and subscribe to blacklivesmattercom for updates and more information to come” this response did not satisfy the qa participants who signaled their disapproval by “downvoting” scales’ reply her post currently has 1163 net votes the top comment on that thread asked “why don’t you post actual links to where the funding goes this is not an answer” several redditors then tried looking up tax information for the foundation questioning whether it is even a 501c3 nonprofit scales also received copious criticism and downvotes on the topic of antisemitism offering only a rote denunciation of “hate speech or bias of any kind” one user gave specific examples of alleged antisemitism in the movement asking how blm will fight bigotry within its own ranks your organization has been accused of antisemitism both by its members it’s alliances and its reverence for avowed jew haters for example the myth that jews were particularly involved in the slave trade seems to be particularly pervasive and pernicious and is entirely fabricated by the nation of islam jews on the streets of brooklyn have been repeatedly targetted by black citizens in violent crimes blm has turned a blind eye to antisemitism in its support of the palestinian cause a cause in no way related to black equality in the united states it should be obvious that equality for blacks people cannot be achieved through bigotry and subjugation of another oppressed group what are you doing to fight bigotry within blm scales flatly denied any problems with jew hatred in the movement “i am not sure where you receive your information but blm is a political home for all those marginalized invisible and oppressed by the dominant culture” she said “we do not support or express hate speech or bias of any kind” that post currently stands at nearly 800 net votes “not surprised at all by their nonanswer” one reply stated “i support the protests police reform and especially black lives but if the organization can’t even disavow the many antisemitic statements and dog whistles it puts out there needs to be a better group leading this

nominee to face president trump at the ballot box in november is now facing a real detailed allegation of sexual misconduct from a former staffer this goes further than the “creepy uncle joe” narrative that is laughed off by democrats republicans and members of the media tara reade a former aide to thensenator biden dde alleges that biden “began kissing her without her permission pushed her against a wall reached under her skirt and penetrated her with his fingers” during an encounter on capitol hill time’s up legal defense a nonprofit designed to help women combat sexual assault struggles from a legal stand point is said to have declined reade’s plea for help per the intercept time’s up allegedly told reade that their nonprofit status and bidens political stature prevented them from helping her come forward with her story the intercept also pointed out that a top official at the public relations firm tied to time’s up is advising biden’s campaign reade says that she brought her story to the campaigns of sens kamala harris dca and elizabeth warren dma but was given no help the latter sentence embodies the hypocrisy entwined within the handling at least thus far of this graphic allegation against the presumptive democratic nominee sens harris and warren alongside other democratic colleagues were at the forefront of the blisteringly partisan fight against the confirmation of soontobe justice brett kavanaugh before the allegations of sexual misconduct against judge kavanaugh became public knowledge democratic senators were determined to derail kavanaugh’s nomination their opposition had little to do with dr fords allegations and everything to do with preventing a conservative jurist from sitting on the supreme court democrats in the upper chamber saw the misconduct allegations from dr christine blasey ford as an avenue to do so and their allies in the mainstream media absolutely crucified kavanaugh before he was even able to testify wore black today in support of all survivors of sexual assault or abuse we wont let them be silenced or ignored believesurvivors pictwittercomimmvdgsepx — kamala harris kamalaharris september 24 2018 last year the kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him confirmation is not exoneration and these newest revelations are disturbing like the man who appointed him kavanaugh should be impeached — elizabeth warren ewarren september 15 2019 democratic senators were very obviously using dr ford’s visibly painful allegations as a delay tactic on kavanaugh’s nomination in hopes of taking back the senate majority in the november midterm elections fortunately their partisan endeavor failed nowjustice kavanaugh was given his wellearned seat on the bench and sen mitch mcconnell rky remains majority leader of the upper chamber the hypocrisy that i previously alluded to is this the same democrats who wasted no time trying to derail kavanaugh’s nomination as soon as the misconduct allegations were made public have remained silent on the allegation against biden nearly a week after reade went public many of these democrats have endorsed biden for president leading up to and during justice kavanaugh’s confirmation the left invented the “believe all women” standard for the handling of sexual assault allegations this nonsense standard which holds no legal standing very obviously violates due process and goes against the fundamentals of fair jurisprudence but this standard is embraced by democrats here is bidens campaign manager symone sanders lambasting senate republicans for not taking dr fords allegations seriously at the time she was an aide to sen bernie sanders dvt presidential campaign senate republicans bent over backwards to accommodate dr ford and allow her to tell her story heres what joe bidens campaign manager symonedsanders used to say about the urgency of treating sexual assault allegations against powerful men seriously when the powerful man in question was brett kavanaughpictwittercomspzmbhznvx — glenn greenwald ggreenwald march 31 2020 they are sending a message that they care more about putting a supreme court justice on the bench that will do what they want them to do as opposed to seriously and investigating and taking a womans charges seriously she said on cnn during the kavanaugh confirmation battle the mainstream media has also been oddly quiet after reades allegation against biden became public given their complete crucifixion of kavanaugh when dr ford came forward as robby soave of reason highlights to name names the new york times wrote about fords allegation before she was public without naming her or interviewing her reade is out on the record and naming herself but the times hasnt mentioned her — robby soave robbysoave march 30 2020 cnn interviewed biden on friday but didnt ask him nbc interviewed him sunday and also didnt ask him — robby soave robbysoave march 30 2020 i mean i actually support proceeding extremely cautiously with these things but again the kavanaugh case is very analogous and in fact what reade has accused biden of is significantly worse — robby soave robbysoave march 30 2020 reades allegation against biden comes with corroboration of familiarity with the story from two family members as the federalist points out no friends of dr ford nor witnesses present at the alleged party in the summer of 1982 could corroborate dr fords story but her word alone was enough for senate democrats almost a week after these allegations against biden which appear substantive and graphic on the surface the same democratic senators and pundits who wasted no time calling for kavanaugh to rescind his nomination are silent on tara reade’s story this is not democrats first instance of silence when one of their own is accused democrats ignored graphic allegations of domestic violence against former democratic national committee dnc vicechair keith ellison and have historically turned a blind eye to the multitude of sexual misconduct allegations former president bill clinton the “believe all women” standard has no legitimate legal standing and even makes the preponderance of evidence standard present in former president obamas dear colleague letter appear constitutional by comparison no one who is pressing allegations of such a heinous sexual crime should be believed at facevalue on the sole basis of their gender let alone without evidentiary support or witness corroboration women and men who come forward deserve to be heard as does the accused party but this very basic tenet of due process via the fifth amendment has been put on the backburner by the left the believe all women standard actually does a disservice to real victims of these heinous sex crimes by pledging to believe anyone who makes a single charge of a crime of this nature real victims are burdened and discouraged from coming forward biden himself has embraced the “believe all women” standard which goes against our fundamental legal fabrics per national review what should happen is the woman should be given the benefit of the doubt and not be you know abused again by the system i hope that they understand what courage it takes for someone to come forward and relive what they believe happened to them and let them state it but treat her with respect former vice president biden deserves the due process and fair treatment that justice kavanaugh was not fully afforded just as tara reade deserves the opportunity to tell her story as dr ford was able to because of senate republicans senate democrats made it clear that evidence and witness corroboration have no role to play in the handling of misconduct allegations at least if the accused is a republican by their own legal facade biden should be unqualified to be the democratic nominee unless of course the believe all women standard was invented to derail a qualified conservative jurists nomination with an otherwise spotless record via unsubstantiated misconduct allegations

byj9xu,2019-06-09 14:25:07,Republican,State investigation finds YEARS of Rep. Ilhan Omar Tax Fraud,https://pcmdnews.com/state-investigation-finds-years-of-rep-ilhan-omar-tax-fraud/,PCmustDie,633,63,us rep ilhan omar’s tax filings came under scrutiny friday after minnesota campaign finance investigators revealed she had filed jointly with a man to whom she wasn’t legally married for two consecutive years before she took elected office the revelation was seized on by some conservative media outlets and social media pundits who said the situation was tantamount to tax fraud — a charge omar denied a campaign spokesman for the minneapolis democrat issued the following statement friday “all of rep omar’s tax filings are fully compliant with all applicable tax law” according to a report from the campaign finance and public disclosure board omar and ahmed hirsi filed jointly in 2014 and 2015 she’s currently married to hirsi but at the time she wasn’t — an apparent violation of tax laws and regulations that omar appears to have rectified the irs only allows a couple to file a joint tax return if the state they reside in recognizes the relationship as a legal marriage unmarried couples are never eligible to file joint returns complicating matters further omar was legally married to a different man at the time the campaign finance board report found that omar had violated state campaign finance laws and some of those violations related to payments made to an accounting firm that appears to have corrected the tax filing — but the thrust of omar’s campaign finance violations were about unrelated matters the tax fraud violations by us rep ilhan omar were discovered while she was being investigated for violating state rules when she used campaign funds to pay for personal outofstate travel and help on her tax returns the campaign finance board has not referred the issue to any criminal investigators and its investigators did not look at the actual tax filings but relied on interviews with several people including omar’s attorney according to its report and executive director jeff sigurdson here’s a timeline that helps explain it based on public records and reporting by the pioneer press and associated press omar’s marriages and taxes 2002 omar applies for license to marry ahmed abdisalan hirsi then named ahmed abdisalan aden according to hennepin county records records show a marriage certificate wasn’t issued and omar has said they didn’t pursue a civil marriage but instead married in their muslim “faith tradition” according to the ap 2008 omar and hirsi end their relationship according to omar they had two children by this time 2009 omar marries ahmed nur said elmi according to a hennepin county marriage certificate elmi a british citizen is the person some conservative media have alleged to be omar’s brother as part of an immigration scheme omar has strongly denied this last year the ap extensively looked into this allegation 2011 omar and elmi end their relationship and divorce in their faith tradition according to omar but they take no legal action to end the marriage until 2017 2012 omar and hirsi reunite and have a third child according to hennepin county records 2014 omar and hirsi file joint tax returns according to the campaign finance board 2015 omar and hirsi again file joint tax returns according to campaign finance board report during both these years omar remains legally married to elmi and not legally married to hirsi although she and hirsi are together it’s not known whether they filed jointly for any other years state and federal laws appear to say that omar and hirsi should not have been allowed to file jointly during these years the campaign finance board does not possess the actual tax filings and the pioneer press was unable to review them 2016 attorney carla kjellberg is hired by omar’s campaign as part of a “crisis committee” to address issues related to her marital and immigration status and history kjellberg hires accounting firm frederick rosen to review omar’s financial records frederick rosen review omar’s 2014 and 2015 tax filings and report that something in omar’s tax filings needs to be corrected according to the campaign finance board in a recent interview with campaign finance officials kjellberg describes it as “correcting something that could have been detrimental to ms omar” in november omar is elected to the minnesota house — the first time she has held elected office 2017 omar files for divorce from elmi kjellberg serves as her divorce attorney kjellberg was not paid for the divorce work by omar’s campaign 2018 omar’s marriage to elmi legally ends in divorce early in the year a month later she legally marries hirsi in november omar is elected to congress june 2019 the minnesota campaign finance and public disclosure board reveals that omar and hirsi filed joint tax returns as part of a report from an investigation into whether omar’s campaign violated state spending and reporting requirements the campaign did commit violations the report concludes and omar is ordered to reimburse her former campaign committee nearly 3500 mostly for personal travel and is fined 500 omar says she will comply

Matter,https://thelibertyloft.com/two-officers-shot-and-the-left-responds-by-mocking-blue-lives-matter/,TheLibertyLoft,631,78,share this article reading time 4 minutes charlotte nc — late saturday evening the la county sherriff’s department tweeted that two of their deputies were shot in the line of duty the deputies were ambushed by a shooter while they were sitting in a car no warning no provocation just sheer hatred of law enforcement officers the video below was shared on twitter of the shooting as the suspect is still at large both officers required surgery due to their injuries and are fighting for their lives no title update the gunman walked up on the deputies and opened fire without warning or provocation pictwittercomcbqjykkoxj the continued violence against law enforcement across our country is a direct result of the democrat’s actions joe biden and kamala harris own this democrat governors and mayors across the country own this the mainstream media also owns this for the actions they continue to take in labeling officers murderers and killers they have created a social environment where there is widespread disrespect and hatred of law enforcement across this country rather than the “peaceful protests” that they claim they are allowing violence and destruction making our cities and towns look like war zones this is not president trump’s fault as the democrats would like you to believe president trump was correct when he said that these people are animals that need to be stopped these people need to see that our country is one of law and order and one that respects our law enforcement for the job that they do how did the leftwing of our country respond after the shooting rather than saying that this event should not have happened they proceeded to mock law enforcement by making fun of the situation and the hashtag “bluelivesmatter” on twitter some of the tweets said that the only real heroes were healthcare workers that wore blue scrubs at work other tweets said that the only blue lives that mattered were cartoons like the smurfs or birds here’s one from a freelance journalist out of philadelphia saying that blue lives matter deserves no respect no title let’s be clear about something bluelivesmatter is the latest in a long history of rightwing false equivocations along with any other appropriations of blacklivesmatter it doesn’t honor police and it doesn’t warrant our respect there were many other tweets that said if you support blue lives matter then you are a racist so just because you respect law enforcement and say that they deserve to live just like the left claims that blacks do it’s racist taking a few moments to just read through the ignorance that is on twitter about those two law enforcement officers will make you sick what is happening across our country is insane if you still believe that this black lives matter protest and agenda is really about black lives then you are not paying attention these leftwing radicals are not concerned one bit about black lives they are only concerned with the complete revolution of the united states when i say leftwing radicals let me be clear about who i am including in that group i include joe biden kamala harris and anyone else in political office that has catered to the black lives matter movement these socialists and communists that are attempting to alter the course of our country under the disguise of “social justice” and “systemic racism” causes i am 100 completely against racism it has no place in our country and i am against it 100 i am also completely against hatred and disrespect like this which the democrats are fostering all across our country our law enforcement deserves better than the treatment they are getting from the left americans deserve better from their elected officials and those who claim they love america as of the time of this writing there is not one statement from these radical leftwing leaders about this shooting nothing from joe biden kamala harris nancy pelosi or chuck schumer there is nothing from bernie sanders elizabeth warren aoc ilhan omar or any of the other stars of the democratic party in her most recent tweet elizabeth warren said that america is crying out for leadership she said that trump was fanning the flames of racism ignoring covid19 and leading like a fascist dictator the thing is of all the names mentioned he’s the only one to call out how this act is sickening you may not like the fact that he called this person an animal but he is the only one that said anything about those two officers the left will spend the day mocking law enforcement and making fun of blue lives as they celebrate the shooting of two more officers being shot i will be praying for those two

confirmed the ja issued guidance to other judge advocates throughout the department of the air force which includes the space force about the omb memo “the department of the air force continues to provide unconscious bias training in accordance with department of defense directives and is reviewing all course material to ensure it is compliant with the omb memorandum” stefanek wrote in a tuesday email the air force has for years tried to improve diversity in its ranks in the months since the death of george floyd a black man killed at the hands of minneapolis police and the nationwide conversation on race that followed the air force has particularly sought to address its own racial disparities and unconscious biases in things like promotions career opportunities and the military

of a major review of racial disparities in the ranks it’s unclear how much air force training teaches airmen that the united states is inherently racist or evil however the unofficial facebook page air force amnncosnco last month posted a slide from a presentation at joint base langleyeustis in virginia that listed some examples of white privilege the slide asked airmen to “please take a moment and understand” the concept of white privilege the slide showed two news stories about burglary suspects with a group of white suspects pictured wearing suits and ties and the black suspects portrayed in police mug shots task and purpose confirmed the slide was part of a presentation at langley in the omb memo vought cited unnamed press reports that federal employees have been “required to attend trainings where they are told that ‘virtually all white people contribute to racism’ or where they are required to say that they ‘benefit from racism” playcirclefilled race and the air force the truth about how minorities get promoted as a young africanamerican officer larry spencer regularly sought out career advice from black senior officers all too often the message he received was unsettling vought also said that in some cases the training materials have further claimed there is racism embedded in the belief that america is the land of opportunity or the belief that the most qualified person should receive a job” the air force ja memo noted that examining training on issues of race and whether that training contains elements barred by the omb memo “can be subjective” this memo said the ja does not believe that training consistent with the principles laid out in the defense department’s diversity management and equal opportunity and air force equal opportunity guidelines violates the criteria laid out in the omb memo that means the ja said that training on the air force providing opportunities for all of its personnel to reach the highest level of responsibility their abilities will allow does not cross the boundaries laid out in the omb memo training on equal opportunity diversity and inclusion initiatives to increase opportunities for personnel and against unlawful discrimination harassment or reprisal on the basis of race is also not barred by the memo the ja said however the air force memo said any training that teaches “virtually all white people contribute to racism” requires service members or civilians to say they “benefit from racism” includes “white privilege” or “critical race theory teaches or suggests “the united states is an inherently racist or evil country” or teaches or suggests that “any race or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil” is out of bounds the ja’s memo cites the dictionary definition of white privilege as “the set of social and economic advantages that white people have by virtue of their race in a culture characterized by racial inequality” and it says critical race theory in general “is a theoretical framework which posits the belief that institutional racism is engrained in american society” valerie insinna contributed to this report
gtyvjg,2020-05-31 16:15:32,Republican,Andrew McCarthy: Laws against rioting and terrorism must be enforced against Antifa and other violent radicals,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/andrew-mccarthy-laws-against-rioting-and-terrorism-must-be-enforced-against-violent-radicals-ravaging-cities,Foubar,623,85,attorney general william barr issued a statement saturday decrying the rioters who have violently hijacked peaceful protests over the killing of george floyd by minneapolis police the attorney general made explicit reference to “groups of outside radicals and agitators” who are pursuing a “separate and violent agenda” barr added “in many places it appears the violence is planned organized and driven by anarchist and far left extremists using antifalike tactics many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence” the mention of antifa is significant it is a looselyknit interstate movement whose objective is to wage a terrorist war against the united states using violence against the government and our civilian infrastructure dueling claims trump blames antifa for riots minnesota officials point fingers at white supremacists and cartels equally salient is the attorney general’s assertion that the radical groups involved in the rioting are pursuing a specific violent agenda that obviously refers to the ongoing campaign to coerce acceptance by the country of these groups’ counterconstitutional totalitarianism barr vowed that the justice department will take enforcement action across the nation this is worth pausing over particularly because when these uprisings occur as they do with disturbing frequency there are inevitable calls for the enactment of domestic terrorism laws i’ve investigated and prosecuted terrorists – jihadists who adhered to foreign terrorist organizations but operated domestically as well as those who attacked american interests overseas i can thus tell you that the laws we already have are more than adequate to the task there is no need for new laws calls to enact them are either illconceived or the usual case of preening politicians sensing the need to look like they’re doing something in response to a crisis rioters can and will do immense damage if as some foolishly suggest we wait for them to exhaust themselves i led the 1990s prosecution of the jihadists who bombed the world trade center and then planned a more ambitious campaign – which fortunately we thwarted – to bomb such new york city landmarks as the lincoln and holland tunnels the united nations complex the fbi’s lower manhattan field office some military installations and so on concurrently the terrorists plotted political kidnappings and assassinations as well as jailbreaks of imprisoned jihadists they were unable to execute these ambitions schemes but it was not for lack of preparation including extensive paramilitary training this is why attorney general barr’s mention of the violent agenda of the rioters pinged my antennae we prosecuted the socalled blind sheikh the late omar abdel rahman and his subordinates using a civil warera statute that criminalizes “seditious conspiracy” this rarely invoked penal law targets conspiracies to levy war against the united states or to forcibly oppose or overthrow our government the key element is violence – either its use or planned use that is the attribute that fundamentally distinguishes legitimate protest from insurrection the attorney general also pointed out in his statement that it is a federal crime to cross state lines or use interstate facilities in order to incite or participate in rioting indeed it is and this also raises the specter of federal racketeering laws we think of these principally as a vehicle for prosecuting organized crime groups but they actually apply to any “enterprise” which is simply an association of some kind it could be informal and secretive like a mafia “family” or a drug cartel or it could a more formal entity racketeering laws have been applied to corporations guilds political parties labor unions and so on click here to sign up for our opinion newsletter the racketeering enterprise must affect interstate commerce through a pattern of criminal activity this would enable the justice department to investigate outfits like antifa which are organized around a nihilistic vision and which dispatch members throughout the country to commit mayhem seriously injuring americans and destroying property our existing laws at both the federal and state levels are more than adequate to the task of dealing with terrorism and seditionist violence the justice department and the fbi including the bureau’s joint terrorism task forces partnerships with police authorities in major cities throughout the country are highly experienced and adept in this area and they have the resources to get the job done the job needs doing the ravaging of our major cities right now is a violation of the rights of peaceloving americans both those who are legitimately exercising their first amendment rights to protest and those who are going about their lives expecting the governmental protection to which the constitution entitles them click here to get the fox news app for society to flourish the rule of law must assert itself justice must be done which means bringing antiamerican domestic terrorists to heel rioters can and will do immense damage if as some foolishly suggest we wait for them to exhaust themselves the failure to confront radicals only increases their energy and appetite to do harm order does not happen spontaneously it takes a commitment to enforce the laws click here to read more by andrew mccarthy

inside west freeway church of christ in texas where a gunman opened fire on parishioners west freeway church livestream yes good guys with guns can save lives they just did in the west freeway church of christ the same weekend that orthodox jews in monsey ny were fighting off another knifewielding antisemite thug with chairs and coffee tables — they were fortunate that the perpetrator hadn’t brought a firearm like the killer who targeted a yeshiva in jersey city only a few weeks earlier — jack wilson a 71yearold congregant and security volunteer at west freeway church of christ in white settlement texas took mere seconds to stop a potential mass murderer advertisement earlier in the year to the dismay of the usual suspects texas governor greg abbott had signed a bill making it explicitly legal for texans with concealedcarry licenses to bring their weapons into places of worship these kinds of protections allowed wilson to achieve something that no gun laws now being pursued nationally by democrats has ever accomplished he stopped a mass shooter my guess is that wilson a former deputy sheriff is the kind of guy who probably wouldn’t have broken the law and carried a firearm into church had it been illegal to do so the killer on the other hand i’m wholly certain would have been undeterred by any laws yet allowing people who pass ongoing criminalbackground checks and take statemandated training courses to bring their guns to a church or a school is a move that generates tremendous hostility among guncontrol advocates we must “do something” about gun violence but we’ve learned that in the liberal vernacular that’s nothing more than a euphemism for “do something to inhibit lawabiding citizens from owning guns” advertisement even when abbott signed the law that clarified the right of people to enter churches with concealed firearms unless otherwise prohibited it was framed as something nefarious by the media “texas loosens firearm laws hours after the state’s latest mass shooting left five dead” one cnn piece noted after the walmart shooting in el paso in september as if clarifying the constitutional right to protect oneself from bigoted killers is somehow helping the bigoted killers democraticparty frontrunner joe biden called the texas law “irrational” now if you don’t even believe that trained and licensed safetyconscious americans should be allowed to protect themselves their community and their family in a place of worship then you’re not a moderate you just don’t believe in the second amendment or the right to selfdefense — what john adams quoting blackstone referred to as “the primary canon in the law of nature” there is of course no panacea for the problem of deranged people shooting up churches and schools the argument however that guns rarely stop these events is highly misleading when one considers that most highprofile mass shootings happen in gunfree zones and concealed carriers are some of the most lawabiding citizens in the country it is also impossible to quantify how often the presence of good guys with guns dissuades murders shooters prefer soft targets we also know that while having a gun in the hands of a citizen may not stop most murderers it can sometimes mitigate the damage they inflict two incidents come to mind the shooting at first baptist church of sutherland spring texas where stephen willeford grabbed his ar15 and shot the mass killer before he could do more damage and the case of jeanne assam a congregant security volunteer at the new life church in colorado springs who in 2007 dropped a murderer who had already killed four people in two churches while the chances of being caught up in a mass shooting despite what you may have heard is incredibly rare there is virtually no downside in allowing congregations to govern their own security no one is forcing a church to arm itself the mormon church for instance has banned firearms from all its places of worship yet some states are compelling millions of americans to sit there defenseless advertisement in new york where orthodox jews have increasingly become the target of violence there are no assams or willefords or wilsons allowed draconian laws make it virtually impossible for normal people to practice their right to selfdefense using history as a precedent jews should find this kind of limitation especially offensive one of the greatest triumphs of the state of israel and the chief reason so many antisemites detest it with such ferocity is that jews finally stopped asking for permission to exist and picked up guns to defend themselves the united states is perhaps the only other place in the world where jews are also blessed — or should be — with an inherent right to selfprotection it was the great zionist ze’ev jabotinsky who implored his people to arm in the early 20th century “better to have a gun and not need it than to need it and not have it” was one of his slogans this notion was once widely embraced in the united states apparently it still is in texas

bxy1og,2019-06-07 21:28:51,Republican,"In 50 years of the 'War on Poverty"" the US has taxed over $22 TRILLION dollars from productive people and handed it out to unproductive people. The poverty rate has not budged. Maybe giving people 'free shit' stolen from people who worked for it, isn't a solution to anything",https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/the-war-poverty-after-50-years,VaccineTruth11,618,76,this week the us census bureau is scheduled to release its annual poverty report the report will be notable because this year marks the 50th anniversary of the launch of president lyndon johnson’s war on poverty in his january 1964 state of the union address johnson proclaimed “this administration today here and now declares unconditional war on poverty in america”1 since that time us taxpayers have spent over 22 trillion on antipoverty programs in constant 2012 dollars adjusted for inflation this spending which does not include social security or medicare is three times the cost of all military wars in us history since the american revolution despite this mountain of spending progress against poverty at least as measured by the government has been minimal the welfare–poverty paradox this week the census bureau will most likely report that the poverty rate last year was about 14 percent essentially the same rate as in 1967 three years after the war on poverty was announced as chart 1 shows according to the census there has been no net progress in reducing poverty since the mid to late 1960s since that time the poverty rate has undulated slowly falling by two to three percentage points during good economic times and rising by a similar amount when the economy slows overall the trajectory of official poverty for the past 45 years has been flat or slightly upward the static nature of poverty is especially surprising because as chart 1 also shows poverty fell dramatically during the period before the war on poverty began in 1950 the poverty rate was 322 percent by 1965 the first year during which any war on poverty programs began to operate the rate had been cut nearly in half to 173 percent2 the unchanging poverty rate for the past 45 years is perplexing because antipoverty or welfare spending during that period has simply exploded as chart 2 shows meanstested welfare spending has soared since the start of the war on poverty in fiscal year 2013 the federal government ran over 80 meanstested welfare programs that provided cash food housing medical care and targeted social services to poor and lowincome americans overall 100 million individuals—nearly one in three americans—received benefits from at least one of these programs federal and state governments spent 943 billion in 2013 on these programs at an average cost of 9000 per recipient again social security and medicare are not included in the totals today government spends 16 times more adjusting for inflation on meanstested welfare or antipoverty programs than it did when the war on poverty started but as welfare spending soared the decline in poverty came to a grinding halt as chart 2 shows the more the government spent the less progress against poverty was made how can this paradox be explained how can government spend 9000 per recipient and have no apparent impact on poverty the answer is that it can’t the conundrum of massive antipoverty spending and unchanging poverty rates has a simple explanation the census bureau counts a family as “poor” if its income falls below specific thresholds3 but in counting “income” the census omits nearly all of government meanstested spending on the poor4 in effect it ignores almost the entire welfare state when it calculates poverty this neat bureaucratic ploy ensured that welfare programs could grow infinitely while “poverty” remained unchanged living conditions of the poor in america5 consumption by poor families since the census bureau dramatically undercounts the actual incomes of the poor it should be no surprise to find that the us department of labor routinely reports that poor families spend 240 for every 100 of their reported income6 if public housing benefits are added to the tally the ratio of consumption to income rises to 260 for every 100 in other words the “income” figures that the census bureau uses to calculate poverty dramatically undercount the economic resources available to lowerincome households amenities because the official census poverty report undercounts welfare income it fails to provide meaningful information about the actual living conditions of less affluent americans the government’s own data show that the actual living conditions of the more than 45 million people deemed “poor” by the census bureau differ greatly from popular conceptions of poverty7 consider these facts taken from various government reports8 eighty percent of poor households have air conditioning by contrast at the beginning of the war on poverty only about 12 percent of the entire us population enjoyed air conditioning nearly threequarters have a car or truck 31 percent have two or more cars or trucks9 nearly twothirds have cable or satellite television twothirds have at least one dvd player and a quarter have two or more half have a personal computer one in seven has two or more computers more than half of poor families with children have a video game system such as an xbox or playstation fortythree percent have internet access forty percent have a widescreen plasma or lcd tv a quarter have a digital video recorder system such as a tivo ninetytwo percent of poor households have a microwave for decades the living conditions of the poor have steadily improved consumer items that were luxuries or significant purchases for the middle class a few decades ago have become commonplace in poor households in part this is caused by a normal downward price trend following the introduction of a new product initially new products tend to be expensive and available only to the affluent over time prices fall sharply and the product becomes widely prevalent throughout the population including poor households this is a general sign of desirable economic progress liberals use the declining relative prices of many amenities to argue that even though poor households have air conditioning computers cable tv and widescreen tvs they still suffer from substantial material deprivation in basic needs such as food and housing here again the data tell a different story poverty nutrition and hunger despite impressions to the contrary most of the poor do not experience undernutrition hunger or food shortages10 information on these topics is collected by the household food security survey of the us department of agriculture the usda survey shows that in 2009 ninetysix percent of poor parents stated that their children were never hungry at any time during the year because they could not afford food some 83 percent of poor families reported that they had enough food to eat some 82 percent of poor adults reported that they were never hungry at any time in the prior year due to lack of money to buy food as a group america’s poor are far from being chronically undernourished the average consumption of protein vitamins and minerals is virtually the same for poor and middleclass children and in most cases is well above recommended norms poor children actually consume more meat than do higherincome children and have average protein intakes 100 percent above recommended levels11 most poor children today are in fact supernourished and grow up to be on average one inch taller and 10 pounds heavier than the gis who stormed the beaches of normandy in world war ii12 housing and poverty tv newscasts about poverty in america generally depict the poor as homeless or as residing in dilapidated living conditions while some families do experience such severe conditions they are far from typical of the population defined as poor by the census bureau the actual housing conditions of poor families are very different13 over the course of a year only 4 percent of poor persons become temporarily homeless at a single point in time one in 70 poor persons is homeless14 only 95 percent of the poor live in mobile homes or trailers 495 percent live in separate singlefamily houses or townhouses and 40 percent live in apartments fortytwo percent of all poor households actually own their own homes the average home owned by persons classified as poor by the census bureau is a threebedroom house with oneandahalf baths a garage and a porch or patio only 7 percent of poor households are overcrowded more than twothirds have more than two rooms per person the average poor american has more living space than the average individual living in sweden france germany or the united kingdom these comparisons are to the average citizens in foreign countries not to those classified as poor15 the vast majority of the homes or apartments of the poor are in good repair and without significant defects by his own report the average poor person had sufficient funds to meet all essential needs and was able to obtain medical care for his family throughout the year whenever needed of course poor americans do not live in the lap of luxury the poor clearly struggle to make ends meet but they are generally struggling to pay for cable tv air conditioning and a car as well as food for the table the average poor person is far from affluent but his lifestyle is equally far from the images of stark deprivation purveyed by advocacy groups and the mainstream media the challenges go much deeper than a lack of material resources was the war on poverty a success do the higher living standards of the poor mean that the war on poverty has been successful the answer is no for two reasons first the incomes and living standards of less affluent americans were rising rapidly well before the war on poverty began see charts 1 and 2 second and more important to assess the war on poverty we must understand president johnson’s actual goal when he launched it the original goal of the war on poverty was not to prop up living standards artificially through an everexpanding welfare state instead johnson declared that his war would strike “at the causes not just the consequences of poverty”16 he added “our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty but to cure it and above all to prevent it”17 in other words president johnson was not proposing a massive system of everincreasing welfare benefits doled out to an everenlarging population of beneficiaries his proclaimed goal was not a massive new system of government handouts but an increase in selfsufficiency a new generation capable of supporting themselves out of poverty without government handouts lbj actually planned to reduce not increase welfare dependence he declared “we want to give the forgotten fifth of our people opportunity not doles”18 he claimed that his war would enable the nation to make “important reductions” in future welfare spending the goal of the war on poverty he stated would be “making taxpayers out of taxeaters”19 because he viewed the war on poverty as a means to increase selfsupport johnson proclaimed that it would be an “investment” that would “return its cost manifold to the entire economy” measuring selfsufficiency how has the war on poverty fared with respect to president johnson’s paramount goal of promoting selfsufficiency what return have the taxpayers reaped from their 22 trillion “investment” paradoxically the answers to these questions are best provided by the census bureau’s official poverty statistics as noted census poverty figures are misleading as a measure of actual living conditions because they exclude nearly all welfare assistance they do however provide a fairly accurate measure of a family’s wages and earnings this means that the official census “poverty” figures are in fact a good measure of president johnson’s original goal of promoting “selfsufficiency” the ability of a family to sustain itself above the poverty level through its own work and investment without reliance on welfare aid chart 3 repeats the official census “poverty” figures from chart 1 but relabels them more accurately as a “selfsufficiency” index the story told by the chart is striking in the decade and a half before the start of the war on poverty lowincome americans experienced dramatic improvements in selfsufficiency the share of americans who lacked selfsufficiency was cut nearly in half falling from 322 percent in 1950 to 173 percent in 1965 during the first six years after johnson announced the war on poverty 1965 to 1970 selfsufficiency continued to improve steadily new government programs were initiated meanstested welfare spending increased sharply from 57 billion in 1964 to 141 billion measured in constant 2012 dollars some authors suggest that the continuing decline in official poverty from 1965 to 1970 demonstrates the initial success of the war on poverty but over 90 percent of the increased spending during this period was in the form of noncash benefits that the census does not count for purposes of measuring poverty20 it is therefore impossible for the expansion of meanstested welfare to have directly produced the large decline in official poverty that occurred during this period programs that in theory could have reduced poverty indirectly by raising wages and employment were regarded as largely ineffective and were limited in scope for example in the late 1960s only 300000 participants per year were enrolled in job corps and related training programs21 thus it is implausible to suggest that the decline in official poverty between 1965 and 1970 was due substantially to the direct or indirect effects of war on poverty programs rather official poverty declined and selfsufficiency improved for the same general reason that these improvements occurred before 1965 a steady rise of wages and education levels unfortunately the situation changed in the early 1970s the steady improvement in selfsufficiency slowed and then came to a halt for the next four decades selfsufficiency has remained stagnant or has slightly worsened the big picture is clear for 20 years from 1950 to 1970 selfsufficiency and official poverty improved dramatically in the next four decades there was no progress at all the selfsufficiency rate remained essentially static in terms of president johnson’s main goal of reducing the “causes” rather than the mere “consequences” of poverty the war on poverty has failed completely despite 22 trillion in spending in fact a significant portion of the population is now less capable of selfsufficiency than it was when the war on poverty began what went wrong the lack of progress in selfsufficiency for the past four decades is stunning many factors have contributed to this problem for example high school graduation rates after increasing rapidly throughout the 20th century largely plateaued after 197022 broad economic factors also played a role especially the slowdown in wage growth among lowskilled male workers since 1973 on the other hand employment and wages among women increased and this should have led to increased selfsufficiency23 although president johnson intended the war on poverty to increase americans’ capacity for selfsupport exactly the opposite has occurred the vast expansion of the welfare state has dramatically weakened the capacity for selfsufficiency among many americans by eroding the work ethic and undermining family structure when johnson launched the war on poverty 7 percent of american children were born outside of marriage today the number is over 40 percent see chart 4 as the welfare state expanded marriage stagnated and single parenthood soared as chart 5 shows there has been no significant increase in the number of marriedcouple families with children both poor and nonpoor in the us since 1965 by contrast the number of singleparent families with children has skyrocketed by nearly 10 million rising from 33 million such families in 1965 to 132 million in 2012 since singleparent families are roughly four times more likely than marriedcouple families to lack selfsufficiency and to be officially poor this unravelling of family structure has exerted a powerful downward pull against selfsufficiency and substantially boosted the official child poverty rate since the beginning of the war on poverty the absolute number of marriedcouple families with children in official poverty has declined but as chart 6 shows the number of singleparent families in official poverty or lacking selfsufficiency has more than tripled increasing from 16 million in 1965 to 48 million today when the war on poverty began 36 percent of poor families with children were headed by single parents today the figure is 68 percent 24 the war on poverty crippled marriage in lowincome communities as meanstested benefits were expanded welfare began to serve as a substitute for a husband in the home eroding marriage among lowerincome americans in addition the welfare system actively penalized lowincome couples who did marry by eliminating or substantially reducing benefits as husbands left the home the need for more welfare to support single mothers increased the war on poverty created a destructive feedback loop welfare promoted the decline of marriage which generated the need for more welfare today unwed childbearing and the resulting growth of singleparent homes is the most important cause of official child poverty25 if poor women who give birth outside of marriage were married to the fathers of their children twothirds would immediately be lifted out of official poverty and into selfsufficiency26 the welfare state has also reduced selfsufficiency by providing economic rewards to ablebodied adults who do not work or who work comparatively little the low level of parental work is a major cause of official child poverty and the lack of selfsufficiency even in good economic times the median poor family with children has only 1000 hours of parental work per year this is the equivalent of one adult working 20 hours per week if the amount of work performed in poor families with children was increased to the equivalent of one adult working fulltime through the year the poverty rate among these families would drop by twothirds27 conclusion this lack of progress in building selfsufficiency is due in major part to the welfare system itself welfare wages war on social capital breaking down the habits and norms that lead to selfreliance especially those of marriage and work it thereby generates a pattern of increasing intergenerational dependence the welfare state is selfperpetuating by undermining productive social norms welfare creates a need for even greater assistance in the future as the war on poverty passes the halfcentury mark it is time to rein in the endless growth in welfare spending and return to lbj’s original goals as the economy improves total meanstested spending should be moved gradually toward prerecession levels ablebodied nonelderly adult recipients in all federal welfare programs should be required to work prepare for work or at least look for a job as a condition of receiving benefits finally—and most important—the antimarriage penalties should be removed from welfare programs and longterm steps should be taken to rebuild the family in lowerincome communities —robert rector is a senior research fellow and rachel sheffield is a policy analyst in the

Party,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/12/of-course-there-is-systemic-racism-in-america-and-/,Foubar,614,126,analysisopinion these past couple of weeks have been some of the saddest i’ve seen in my lifetime as an africanamerican it began with the tragic needless death of george floyd but then quickly escalated into some of the most vicious violent rioting our country has seen in decades the democratic party true to form never lets a crisis go to waste it has seized on what should be a time of healing and instead made the conversation more divisive by lecturing us all about how systemic racism is supposedly rampant in the united states the great irony here is that yes there’s plenty of systemic racism in our country it’s all wrapped up in the history of the democratic party the rot goes deep back to the postcivil war era former slaves and their children were forced for decades to endure the cruel wretched jim crow laws that kept them from advancing in the south and who was all too happy to keep those laws in place the democrats the republican party had planks in its party platforms addressing the rights of africanamericans in the early 20th century the democrats meanwhile used the kkk as their stormtroopers lynching and terrorizing blacks in the south beginning just after the civil war and continued this practice for a century as early as 1888 the republican platform included a plank affirming the “sovereign right of every lawful citizen rich or poor native or foreign born white or black to cast one free ballot in public elections and to have that ballot duly counted” in 1892 the republican platform specifically condemned the “inhuman outrages perpetrated upon american citizens for political reasons in certain southern states of the union” the democrats those paragons of virtue refused to include antilynching planks or planks addressing racial rights in their platform for all of the early 20th century this was the era of woodrow wilson a democratic president who modern democrats like to conveniently forget resegregated different federal government agencies during his presidency there was also a little racist movie called “birth of a nation” wilson loved it so much he thought it would be a great idea to screen it at the white house and viewed the film multiple times a few years later wilson’s fellow democrat and president franklin roosevelt was forwardthinking and progressive enough to express his distaste for asian immigrants and said that immigrants in general had brought “congestion and racial prejudices to our large cities” he would later deny entry into the us to jews who fled from nazicontrolled europe during hitler’s purges years earlier while on the harvard board of overseers roosevelt helped impose a limit on the number of jewish students allowed admittance to the university and of course roosevelt forced some 175000 japaneseamericans into camps throughout the desert southwest during world war ii trampling all over their constitutional rights just because they looked different one of roosevelt’s staunchest supporters was us supreme court justice hugo black who was nominated to the high court in 1937 by roosevelt fdr’s pal justice black was also for what it’s worth a member of the ku klux klan during the 1950s and the beginning of the civil rights era virginia democratic sen harry byrd was so vehemently against the landmark brown v board of education decision that he took the time to write a “southern manifesto” that opposed desegregation in american schools the latter half of the 20th century brought plenty more of its share of racist democratic politicians lyndon johnson who now is lauded as a hero for passing the civil rights act was fond of using the nword behind closed doors and even changed his pronunciation based on regional dialect prior to 1964 johnson was a stalwart against civil rights legislation in congress and was a leader in the massive southern resistance movement of southern states that opposed integration in the 1950s jimmy carter who loved falsely branding anyone who disagreed with him a racist such as ronald reagan supported legislation in the georgia state senate that would have eviscerated the civil rights act in the early 1960s as well as housing rights and in 1976 mr carter stayed with the plains baptist church even as it voted against allowing blacks to join even in the modern era when we’re all supposed to be above such evilness democrats are still stuck in their old ways nothing has changed for the democratic party gov ralph northam virginia democrat wore blackface while in grad school in the 1980s or it might have been a kkk hood we’re still not sure which virginia attorney general mark herring a democrat also has a racist past why aren’t they being protested just this week the congressional democratic leadership committed the worst kind of faux pas by posing in traditional kente cloth in an attempt to outwoke the virtue signaling rioters in our streets black leaders were not impressed systemic racism is indeed a vile problem one that must be addressed immediately when democrats stop pointing fingers and

Decriminalization,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/06/17/texas-republican-party-endorses-marijuana-decriminalization/#31c95e0e5236,Yosoff,606,19,this article is more than 2 years old delegates at the republican party of texas convention on saturday voted to approve platform planks endorsing marijuana decriminalization medical cannabis and industrial hemp they are also calling for a change in cannabiss classification by the federal government we support a change in the law to make it a civil and not a criminal offense for legal adults only to possess one ounce or less of marijuana for personal use punishable by a fine of up to 100 but without jail time reads one of the partys new positions congress should remove cannabis from the list of schedule 1 says another a third asks lawmakers to expand an existing state law that provides patients with limited access to lowthc medical cannabis extracts so that doctors can determine the appropriate use of cannabis to certified patients and a fourth says industrial hemp is a a valuable agricultural commodity that the official gop organ in a red state like texas would voice support for such farreaching cannabis reforms is the latest sign of how mainstream marijuana has become in american politics earlier this month president trump voiced support for pending bipartisan congressional legislation to let states implement their own marijuana legalization laws without federal interference us senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky is shepherding hemp legalization legislation to passage with the support of minority leader chuck schumer dny the democratic party of new york endorsed legalizing marijuana at its convention last month texas republicans like the majority of americans are ready to see more sensible marijuana policies enacted heather fazio coalition coordinator for texans for responsible marijuana policy said in an interview our state wastes valuable criminal justice resources arresting between 6000070000 texans annually delegates took a stand this week for a better approach while it would be preferable for cannabis to be descheduled entirely this call by the texas gop signifies a very positive shift in opinion outright prohibition is not working and texas republicans want to see congress take action to make cannabis more accessible the new planks cleared a multistep process at the party convention—including testimony before and approval by two committees earlier this week—leading up to saturdays vote by nearly 10000 delegates supporting marijuana decriminalization federal cannabis rescheduling and industrial hemp is now the official position of the republican party of texas under current state law possession of up to two ounces of marijuana is a criminal offense punishable by a jail sentence of up to six months and a fine of up to 2000 lawmakers legalized medical use of lowthc medical cannabis extracts in 2015 during last years legislative session bills to provide more comprehensive medical cannabis access and to decriminalize marijuana got record support from lawmakers and advanced in committees but the clock on the legislative session ran out before floor votes could occur cannabis reform activists hope that the new official gop endorsement will provide a boost leading into the next session which begins in january under the current medical cannabis program most patients are being left behind fazio said texas conservatives are seeing the value of medical cannabis and want to see more inclusive access now we will take this to the legislature for action during the 2019 legislative session at the party event this week there were four cannabisfocused booths at which delegates could get information about the issue three from supporters and one from an opposition group marking the first year that marijuana organizations had a presence in the convention expo area according to fazio during a floor debate on platform planks on saturday one delegate moved to narrow the endorsement for hemp to cover support only for the express purpose of nonconsumable products but that was defeated by the convention an earlier party platform approved in 2016 contains a similar medical cannabis expansion plank as well as a hemp one but nothing on federal rescheduling or decriminalizing marijuana the partys new endorsement comes amid a contentious and close us senate race between sen ted cruz r who opposes legalization but has voiced support for respecting state cannabis laws and congressman beto orourke d who has long supported legalizing marijuana outright meanwhile a powerful texas republican rep pete sessions has used his perch as chairman of the house rules committee to block floor votes on cannabis issues in congress over the past several years his bid to be reelected in november is considered a toss up by the cook political report texas democrats hold their convention next week the partys current platform as adopted in 2016 supports decriminalizing marijuana and further legalizing and regulating its use cultivation production and sale as is done with tobacco and alcohol see the full text of

Now it’s an all-purpose epithet for anything conservative.,https://humanevents.com/2020/06/11/the-abuse-of-fascism/,Foubar,600,114,it used to mean something now it’s an allpurpose epithet for anything conservative who among the fallen allied soldiers would have thought that 75 years after their heroic bloody victory over the axis powers in europe “fascism” was still somehow a threat to america and yet the mislabeling of fascism can be found in a variety of political and social contexts today and with increasing frequency—a move dominated by the left though certainly not limited to it “somebody can only present a liberal arts college in america or a dining experience in portland as verging on the fascist if the people complaining are as far away from fascism as it is possible to be” douglas murray in his latest book the madness of crowds pillories the misunderstanding and inflation of the term writing “somebody can only present a liberal arts college in america or a dining experience in portland as verging on the fascist if the people complaining are as far away from fascism as it is possible to be” even when fascism was a genuine threat to western democracy george orwell warned about its misuse writing that its a perfect example of the “decay of language” which can and does lead to “political chaos” and “the worst follies of orthodoxy” today when “antifascist” activists and their apologists misapply the term “fascism” they’re at best forgetting and are at worst discounting our oldest veterans’ heroic achievements by claiming they’re actually at war with fascism today they coopt this legacy and appropriate the real actual sacrifice our veterans made for the nation it’s not just leftanarchist subcultures it’s also elected officials who knowingly abuse the term for political gains—like democratic darling alexandria ocasiocortez who believes “we are not in politics anymore we are in racism … we are in a fascistic government” there is therefore a concerted effort to portray the duly elected american president as a fascist—like gawker’s yearlong trap to try and get the president to retweet socalled ‘fascist content’ “we came up with the idea for that mussolini bot under the assumption that trump would retweet just about anything no matter how dubious or vile the source as long as it sounded like praise for himself” they gloated as though to prove a point the american public needs to understand just how imbecilic most applications of the term “fascist” really are and to be sure they don’t come just from the left claims that president trump represents a fascist threat to the nation are rooted in complete historical illiteracy and serve only as clickbait for an audience ready at the bit to hate donald trump as an ideology fascism was fundamentally incoherent it was mostly a blip in history in which fascist regimes emerged in separate contexts lacking any consistency in either theory or practice in fact—and importantly—historic fascism heavily overlapped with communism so while those who abuse the label today continue to wage war against social disparities the byproduct of innate human differences and a free society of ordered liberty the history of fascism ostensibly demonstrates that it is antifa who have allied themselves with fascism—not the right fascism’s ideological incoherence the difficulty in clearly defining fascism is linked to several things perhaps chief among being that historically there were many fascisms all fascism is nationalistic and therefore exclusionary to a degree but express racial exclusivity barely registered let alone predominated for most fascist regimes dr paul e gottfried has two books on the misuse of fascism one forthcoming the other fascism the career of a concept published in 2017 in these studies gottfried notes how partly because of how varied fascist administrations were the elements which can be described as characteristic of fascism are actually very few regimes associated with the label—mussolini’s italy salazar’s portugal franco’s spain or peron’s argentina—could all be said to be nationalist antiindividualist authoritarian and encouraging to varying degrees of commercial enterprise to meet the needs of the state—but from there things get muddled orwell observed for instance that the characterization of fascist regimes fueling economic growth through military buildup or foreign invasions was not consistent throughout the various regimes religion was also inconsistent catholicism was always at the center of the regimes and movements in portugal spain belgium and austria led by engelbart dollfuss who died resisting hitler but not in italy where many among the partito nazionale fascista nfp adopted forms of neopaganism even while fascism was thriving between the wars there was much disagreement as to what it actually represented some of this was related to there being no “source book” says historian james d forman mein kampf “is not so much a definition of fascism as a projection of what hitler intended to do for germany and to the world” in fact the incoherence of “fascism” compounds when you throw national socialism into the mix all fascism is nationalistic and therefore exclusionary to a degree but express racial exclusivity barely registered let alone predominated for most fascist regimes the implementation of fascism in its various political manifestations and allegiances was also muddled italy for instance led resistance to nazi germany in the midthirties with the antinazi stresa front a consortium of nations aligned against hitler’s thenmounting military belligerence mussolini publicly criticized hitler’s antisemitism had around ten thousand jews in the nfp won praise from zionist troops for whom he provided training and only began antijewish persecutions after 1943 when the germans set up a government in northern italy further mussolini won plaudits from various allied sources with impeccable democratic credentials including churchill fdr new dealadvisor rexford tugwell backtoafrica leader marcus garvey and the thendominant new republic among others when war broke out many european fascists and mussolini and francosympathizers fought against national socialism including the french belgians poles and others something which contrasts with the soviets who allied with the nazis during the nonaggression pact period the ridiculousness of applying the interwar revolutionary right to modern political contexts aside lumping the disparate regimes together is essentially meaningless definitely ahistorical and almost always political fascism’s romance with communism—and eventual break of course there were several overarching elements to align the disparate fascist governments but it’s also interesting to note that there was also a great deal of overlap between these regimes and communism one thing which did align fascist governments was their reactionary nature especially when it came to countering hardleft revolutionary forces this was also where they broke with parliamentary liberalism one thing which did align fascist governments was their reactionary nature especially when it came to countering hardleft revolutionary forces this was also where they broke with parliamentary liberalism all fascist movements were contemptuously viewed as too weak too bourgeois and too unwilling to legitimize violence to oppose communism this same willingness to use violence however put them close to the equally antiliberal communists—whose contingent of street thugs the “people’s shock troops” in italy routinely battled with mussolini’s black shirts when eugen weber examined the “characteristic features of fascism”—distrust of parliament democracy extension of state monopolies and state organization the limitation and repression of independent workingclass movements establishing imperialist economicopolitical units—he found each applying equally well to communism as the uk labour party’s daily herald wrote of the early 1930s “their ‘socialism’ is not the socialism of the labour party… but in many ways it is a creed that is anathema to the big landowners the big industrialists and the big financiers” such extensive similarities may explain why so many fascists began their political career from various forms of the hardleft—including mussolini but without a doubt there were also overarching and important distinctions that separated fascism from communism for instance another thing that unites the various fascists regimes is the acceptance of natural social hierarchy and elite rule—something which explains at least in part why fascism was most fully formed in traditionally catholic countries and especially in italy with its proud roman past this belief of course describes a hard break with communism this belief in a natural social hierarchy had an impact on how these different political ideologies prioritized economic struggles as weber notes while fascist criticism of unregulated capitalism was no doubt in earnest it insisted on class cooperation rather than class warfare this explains why they adopted the roman fasces or boundtogether birch rods which was intended to symbolize the single unified will of the people defending hierarchy dovetails with fascism’s rejection of absolute egalitarianism as did its refusal to accept abstract internationalism globalism—which was of course another hard break with communism defending hierarchy dovetails with fascism’s rejection of absolute egalitarianism as did its refusal to accept abstract internationalism globalism—which was of course another hard break with communism fascism’s emphasis on the ‘historic nation’ at the forefront of state policy ahead of individual rights and its emphasis on historical myth was criticized under communist doctrine as “bourgeois sentimentality” or “mindless chauvinism” in lenin’s words but of course appeals to nationalism especially of minorities frequently popped up in the soviet union and china when it was politically expedient and as orwell wryly noted although nationalism is “universally regarded as inherently fascist” it’s usually “held only to apply to such national movements as the speaker happens to disapprove of”—what natan sharansky refers to for instance as the soviet’s delineation between ‘good nationalism versus bad nationalism’ the final important distinction between fascism and communism is the latter’s utopian endgoal of perfecting the individual through social engineering fascists gottfried writes rejected the communist idea of progress “associated with the spread of equality and cultural and social homogenization” and generally “resisted the vision of human improvability” such a rejection shows that the belief that man can and should be changed and the erasure of human distinctions is very much particular to the communist mindset the contemporary hardleft’s extreme intolerance and pulverizing approach towards any hint of group disparities for instance shows well the endurance communism’s utopia enjoys today conclusion after the war when the allies were drafting the un declaration of human rights the soviets sought to amend its draftwording on free speech and assembly guarantees by banning those rights to socalled “fascists” how they offered to define it curiously enough approaches how antifa treats the term today fascism was apparently “the bloody dictatorship of the most reactionary section of capitalism and monopolies” without understanding fascism and its history the misuse of the term for malignant political purposes—especially to malign conservative populism—will continue the canadian delegate of the session future prime minister lester pearson responded to this attempt with the correct amount of alarm stating that “fascism” was being hijacked by the soviets and intentionally “being blurred by the abuse of applying it to a person or idea which was not communist” delegates from other allied nations such as france and belgium voiced the same criticisms while the un declaration is far from a perfect document thankfully the soviets did not get their wish to abridge even more its guiding principles on free speech and free association once again this generation showed its resilience and scored a big victory for freedom of conscience in the west respecting the legacy of that victory means that later generations like ourselves must keep up that resilience without understanding fascism and its history the misuse of the term for malignant political purposes—especially to malign conservative populism—will continue for many among the left fighting “fascism” isn’t just to fight for human progress it’s a manichean battle between good and evil when framed in those terms as we can see with antifa’s express statements there can be no ethical let alone legal bounds neutralizing extremist and catastrophizing language will go far in bringing back the kind of coolheaded debate and rational dialogue that’s made western liberal democracy possible curbing such language may force the left to realize they are not at war with fascism or evil but with differences differences which are not only inevitable but healthy in a wellfunctioning democracy

better than that” “this is not who we are” “we…we…oh well i never” who is this “we” anyway because elitists see no common ground with us except when they think playing the “we” card gives them some

d19cvm,2019-09-08 13:36:49,Republican,"No, Trump Rallies Didn't Increase Hate Crimes by 226 Percent",https://reason.com/2019/09/06/no-trump-rallies-didnt-increase-hate-crimes-by-226-percent/,Foubar,598,82,in the aftermath of augusts mass shooting in el paso a cursory glance at the news might have left you with the impression that there were two villains that day the white supremacist who viciously killed 22 people and wounded 24 more and president donald trump who supposedly incited him the president cannot be absolved of responsibility for inciting the hatreds that led to el paso read a new york times piece democratic presidential contenders echoed this sentiment with beto orourke saying trumps rhetoric has a lot to do with the shooting and kamala harris alleging that trump was tweeting out the ammunition used by the el paso shooter blaming the words of controversial politicians for the acts of terrorists and lunatics without hard evidence is not new however a recent academic paper reported on by numerous outlets before it went through the peerreview process suggests that trump actually is to blame studying the effects of trumps many campaign rallies on reported hate incidents three professors at the university of north texas and texas am—ayal feinberg regina branton and valerie martinezebers—claim that trump rallies are associated with a 226 percent increase in such incidents naturally their study went viral vox the washington post the san francisco chronicle and cnn all published articles reporting that trumps words are so bad that exposure to them leads to a wave of hate crimes once again democratic politicians piled on your language creates a climate which emboldens violent extremists wrote sen bernie sanders i–vt in a social media post your rhetoric is directly and indirectly inciting hate mr president tweeted rep ilhan omar d–minn is that where the story ends not quite using the same data and statistical procedures as feinberg et al we replicated their studys headline result since we did not have access to the original papers data and code this involved collecting each of the variables mentioned in the original paper and then independently performing the same analysis wherever possible we copied the decisions that are mentioned in the original paper our headline results were very close to those reported in the original paper you can see our work at github using additional data we collected we also analyzed the effect of hillary clintons campaign rallies using the identical statistical framework the ostensible finding clinton rallies contribute to an even greater increase in hate incidents than trump rallies this should be enough to give any reader pause the implied reasoning of those who cited the initial study was that trumps caustic and seemingly racist rhetoric contributed to a crueler more discriminatory climate ripe for hate crimes if this interpretation is correct why did clinton inspire as many if not more hate incidents as trump did did calling millions of americans deplorables promote violence probably not both of these results rely on comparing counties with rallies to other counties without them this produces a glaring problem politicians tend to hold political rallies near where large numbers of people live and in places with more people the raw number of crimes is generally mechanically higher simply put no one should be surprised that orange county california population 319 million was home to both more reported hate incidents 5 and trump rallies 2 than orange county indiana population 19840 which had zero of each nor is it sensible to interpret that one of these differences hate crimes is caused by the other political rallies indeed adding a simple statistical control for county population to the original analysis causes the estimated effect of trump rallies on reported hate incidents to become statistically indistinguishable from zero the study is wrong and yet journalists ran with it anyway how could this happen even if researchers attempt to be unbiased it is easy for ideology to interfere with the practice of the scientific method empirical work requires numerous small assumptions and choices often without obvious right and wrong options that collectively affect the findings the hypotheses that researchers choose to test often reflect their beliefs and when initial statistical findings do not match the researchers gut intuition it is easy to tweak these choices until the analysis works by comparison when a result feels right it is easy to conclude the analysis with minimal further checks in short falling prey to confirmation bias is easy attempting to find errors in a result that deep down you want to be true is hard furthermore the ideological imbalance of academia—where liberals outnumber conservatives six to one—can worsen this while claims deemed conservative may receive much scrutiny those that comport with liberal sensibilities are more likely to go unscrutinized in principle this need not have much impact outside academia a neutral press acting as a gatekeeper need not report unquestioningly about every unpublished study however like academics journalists as a profession are overwhelmingly liberal with four times as many reporters identifying as democrats than as republicans given how little scrutiny was required to reveal the flaws in the thesis that trump rallies cause hate incidents one cannot help but wonder whether its viral status was aided by journalists predisposed to believe its message would a study claiming clinton rallies caused hate crimes to increase by 226 percent have been seized on equally enthusiastically we are skeptical because of this we have some sympathy for the authors of this study—such errors are typically found during peer review and quietly corrected before publication yet these errors have profoundly different implications when they result in widespread extraordinarybutfalse claims in the popular media many of trumps fiercest critics have proclaimed themselves to be staunch defenders of science in the face of a supposedly rising tide of antiscientific sentiment by rushing to promote academic results that are most in line with their own preconceived notions trumps critics risk committing the very error they decry it is bad for america when trump expresses falsehoods or unnecessarily inflammatory rhetoric news organizations of record shouldnt do it either

fla after new florida gov ron desantis suspended him over his handling of last februarys massacre at marjory stoneman douglas high school ap photowilfredo lee fort lauderdale fla ap — new florida gov ron desantis suspended broward county sheriff scott israel on friday over his handling of february’s massacre at marjory stoneman douglas high school saying he “repeatedly failed and has demonstrated a pattern of poor leadership” the republican governor flew to fort lauderdale three days after taking office to remove the democratic sheriff appointing a former police sergeant to serve as acting sheriff gregory tony 40 worked for coral springs police for 12 years before leaving in 2016 to start a company specializing in activeshooter training he is the first africanamerican to serve as broward’s sheriff advertisement desantis said during a news conference outside the sheriff’s office headquarters that israel failed to keep families and children safe before and during the feb 14 shooting that left 14 students and three staff members dead inside the threestory freshman building “the neglect of duty and incompetence that was connected to the massacre at marjory stoneman douglas high school has been well documented and i have no interest in dancing on scott israel’s political grave” desantis said “suffice it to say the massacre might never have happened had broward had better leadership in the sheriff’s department” during the shooting thenbroward deputy scot peterson who was assigned to the school drew his gun but took cover instead of charging inside seven other deputies who arrived within minutes also failed to enter even as officers from neighboring coral springs went into the building israel earlier changed the office’s policy from saying deputies “shall” confront active shooters to “may” he said he didn’t want to deputies to undertake suicide missions deputies also received two calls about suspect nikolas cruz in the months before the massacre saying he had amassed an arsenal and was a potential school shooter but took no action minutes after desantis’ announcement israel said he “wholeheartedly” rejected the governor’s order and would fight it in court arguing that desantis was making a “power grab” against the will of the county’s people who elected him he said desantis was acting on behalf of the national rifle association which quickly blamed the sheriff’s office after the shooting “there was no wrongdoing on my part i served the county honorably” he said “false narratives may continue but not in a court of law in a court of law only the facts matter” advertisement under florida law the governor can suspend elected officials for criminal activity misfeasance incompetence or neglect of duty if israel challenges the suspension the state senate would hold a trial and could either fire or reinstate him desantis’ republican predecessor nowus sen rick scott refused to suspend israel saying he wanted to wait until investigations were completed fred guttenberg whose 14yearold daughter jaime was fatally shot as she ran down a thirdfloor hallway inches from the safety of the stairwell said she and other thirdfloor victims could have been saved if peterson or other deputies had gone inside immediately “one more second and she makes it” guttenberg said “if anybody wants to know what failure means and lack of response means my daughter would have lived if someone had given her one more second” andrew pollack whose 18yearold daughter meadow died on the third floor trying to protect a younger student who also died said “when eight bso deputies listened to shots fired in a school and stayed outside they were following sheriff israel’s policies” a 15member state commission that recently completed its initial report on the shooting said deputies also had about 20 contacts with cruz as a juvenile — mostly over arguments with his nowdeceased mother israel has said none of those contacts warranted an arrest law enforcement members of the state commission investigating the shooting have agreed with that conclusion but commissioners also concluded that the department’s active shooter training had not been effective still pinellas county sheriff bob gualtieri the commission’s chairman and other law enforcement officials on the panel have said they didn’t think israel should be suspended israel 62 was elected sheriff in 2012 after a long career in law enforcement after taking office israel a republican until changing parties shortly before running in 2008 received criticism over his friendship with notorious gop operative roger stone for promoting stone’s inexperienced stepson to detective and for accepting gifts from a wealthy benefactor however community leaders praised his work with the homeless minority and gay communities violent crime went down and he easily won reelection in 2016 to oversee the county’s 2800 deputies shortly after israel’s second term began a man retrieved a handgun from his luggage at fort lauderdale’s airport and opened fire killing five while israel’s deputies apprehended him within 72 seconds the draft of a county report said israel and others didn’t control the chaos

gc8liy,2020-05-02 18:46:02,Republican,Meet the Other Seven—Yes SEVEN—Women Who Are Accusing Biden of Inappropriate Behavior,https://pjmedia.com/election/matt-margolis/2020/04/30/here-are-the-eight-women-who-have-accused-joe-biden-of-inappropriate-behavior-n387062,Foubar,593,59,joe biden is starting to feel the pressure to personally respond to the sexual assault allegations of tara reade while loyalists and liberal hypocrites are defending him her story continues to gain credibility as more witnesses have come forward in addition to countless photos of joe biden acting inappropriately with women and young girls a small number of women have come forward to the media to say that biden acted inappropriately with them these allegations combined with the photographic evidence we’ve seen establishes a pattern of behavior that at the very least shows biden is a man who typically takes liberties with women he meets and perhaps on one occasion crossed the line toward criminal sexual assault there are common themes with these stories particularly that biden’s position as a senator or as the vice president made it difficult for these women to speak at the time of their experiences or even later how many women have remained silent out of fear who can know but biden has a lot to answer for that the media and quite frankly his primary opponents refused to make him answer when these women came forward a year ago let’s recall them and their stories 8 ally coll a former democratic staffer during the 2008 election cycle ally coll was helping run a reception for about 50 people after biden arrived she was introduced to him and according to her biden “leaned in squeezed her shoulders and delivered a compliment about her smile holding her ‘for a beat too long’” “there’s been a lack of understanding about the way that power can turn something that might seem innocuous into something that can make somebody feel uncomfortable” said coll 7 amy lappos a former congressional aide amy lappos a democratic political activist claimed that during a 2009 political fundraiser in greenwich connecticut for us rep jim himes thenvice president joe biden touched her inappropriately “it wasn’t sexual but he did grab me by the head” lappos told the hartford courant last year “he put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me when he was pulling me in i thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth” “i never filed a complaint to be honest because he was the vice president i was a nobody” lappos explained “there’s absolutely a line of decency there’s a line of respect crossing that line is not grandfatherly it’s not cultural it’s not affection it’s sexism or misogyny” 6 caitlyn caruso a college student and sexual assault survivor four years ago at the age of 19 caitlyn caruso a survivor of sexual assault spoke at an event on sexual assault at the university of las vegas which joe biden was also attending caruso says that after sharing her experience with sexual assault biden “rested his hand on her thigh — even as she squirmed in her seat to show her discomfort—and hugged her ‘just a little bit too long’” “it doesn’t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that” she said “these are supposed to be people you can trust” 5 d j hill a writer ms hill met biden at a 2012 fundraiser in minneapolis minnesota and during a photoop with the thenvice president he put his hand on her shoulder and starting lowering it down her back making her feel “very uncomfortable” hill’s husband noticed biden’s maneuver and protected his wife by putting his own hand on biden’s shoulder and telling a joke ms hill didn’t say anything at the time and doesn’t know what his intent was or if he was aware of her discomfort “only he knows his intent” she told the new york times “but norms are changing now she said and “if something makes you feel uncomfortable you have to feel able to say it” 4 vail kohnertyount a former white house intern vail kohnertyount was a white house intern and says that in the spring of 2013 while trying to exit the basement of the west wing she was asked to step aside to allow for joe biden to enter after moving out of the way biden approached her to shake her hand and introduce himself during this encounter she says biden “put his hand on the back of my head and pressed his forehead to my forehead” and called her “a pretty girl” she says she was shocked by the incident describing it as “the kind of inappropriate behavior that makes many women feel uncomfortable and unequal in the workplace” 3 lucy flores a former nevada state assemblywoman lucy flores wrote an essay describing her experience with joe biden at a 2014 campaign rally during which she says biden touched her inappropriately and kissed her on the head “just before the speeches we were ushered to the side of the stage where we were lined up by order of introduction as i was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd i felt two hands on my shoulders i froze why is the vicepresident of the united states touching me “i felt him get closer to me from behind he leaned further in and inhaled my hair i was mortified i thought to myself “i didn’t wash my hair today and the vicepresident of the united states is smelling it and also what in the actual fuck why is the vicepresident of the united states smelling my hair” he proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head my brain couldn’t process what was happening i was embarrassed i was shocked i was confused” flores said she “wanted nothing more” than to get biden away from her when her name was called she says she was “never happier to get on stage in front of an audience” 2 sofie karasek a sexual assault survivor in 2016 sofie karasek was one of 50 sexual assault survivors who appeared on stage with lady gaga at the oscars joe biden had introduced lady gaga on stage after the ceremony karasek shared with biden a story about a college student who committed suicide after being sexually assaulted and biden according to the washington post “responded by clasping her hands and leaning down to place his forehead against hers” the moment was photographed and went viral but it was actually an uncomfortable moment for karasek she says it felt awkward and uncomfortable having their faces mere inches apart and she didn’t know how to respond to it but she described it as biden “crossing the boundary into her personal space at a sensitive moment” “he emphasized that he wants to connect with people and of course that’s important but again all of our interactions and friendships are a twoway street … too often it doesn’t matter how the woman feels about it or they just assume that they’re fine with it” she said 1 tara reade a former biden senate staffer tara reade’s allegations are perhaps the first to gain traction in the media in 2019 she said that biden used to touch her inappropriately while she was a staffer in his senate office in 1993 “he used to put his hand on my shoulder and run his finger up my neck” reade said “i would just kind of freeze and wait for him to stop doing that” she has since expanded on those allegations claiming in march 2020 that biden sexually assaulted her by pushing her up against the wall kissing her and sliding his hand up her shirt and up her skirt reade attempted to file a claim but biden was ultimately protected by loyalists on his staff the credibility of her claims was boosted by the release of a clip of the larry king live show during which her mother called in anonymously asking the panel for

dp5qdi,2019-10-30 15:00:07,Republican,"Medical Examiner states Jeffrey Epstein’s injuries consistent with homicide, not suicide",https://www.foxnews.com/us/forensic-pathologist-jeffrey-epstein-homicide-suicide,electricspook,592,12,the body of disgraced money man and sex offender jeffrey epstein who was found dead in his manhattan federal prison cell in august bore telltale signs of homicide despite an official ruling that he killed himself a pioneering forensic pathologist revealed to “fox friends” in an exclusive interview wednesday the bombshell claim by dr michael baden a former new york city medical examiner who has worked on highprofile cases during a fivedecade medical career is certain to reignite suspicions that surfaced immediately after epstein who was awaiting trial on federal sextrafficking charges involving underage girls was discovered dead in his cell on aug 10 baden who was hired by epstein’s brother and observed the autopsy told fox news its findings are more consistent with homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging he noted that the 66yearold epstein had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx specifically the thyroid cartilage or adam’s apple as well as one fracture on the left hyoid bone above the adam’s apple baden told fox news “those three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation” baden who is also a fox news contributor said while there’s not enough information to be conclusive yet the three fractures were “rare” said baden whos probed cases involving oj simpson president john f kennedy martin luther king record producer phil spector new england patriots star aaron hernandez and many others “i’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case” the 85yearold medical legend told fox news epsteins attorneys not satisfied with autopsy results that concluded financier died by hanging baden whos examined more than 20000 bodies and hosted hbos autopsy explained that if a person weighed 120 pounds and their head weighed 10 pounds there would be 110 pounds of pressure on the neck at the jaw during a hanging but if someone put a hand around a persons neck and squeezed that could double or even triple the pressure on the neck baden said there were also hemorrhages in epstein’s eyes that were common in homicidal strangulation and uncommon though not unheard of in suicidal hangings the forensic pathologist said “the prominent hemorrhage in the soft tissues of the neck next to the fractures is evidence of a fresh neck compression that could have caused the death” baden said baden stressed his independent study was not complete “the investigation is not completed until all the information has come in” he said epstein was found hanging in his prison cell at the highsecurity metropolitan correctional center in manhattan and was later declared dead investigators said prosecutors alleged that the previously convicted sex offender paid girls as young as 14 hundreds of dollars for massages before he molested them in his homes in new york and palm beach fla between 2002 and 2005 he was awaiting trial in federal prison thus federal agencies presumably the fbi and justice department had jurisdiction over the investigation into his death baden explained some jail staffers not cooperating with doj investigation into epstein suicide source says he said it was unknown to him and the epstein family what work the feds may have done and what results they might have the ligature or item used to tie something tightly allegedly was made from a sheet that had been twisted and put around epstein’s neck baden said evidence on the cloth material could help prove whether or not someone else was involved in epsteins death “whoever it is would have their dna all over the ligature” he said “we don’t have those results yet” he added saying those results “should be reported quickly to give an idea and lessen the speculation” new york city medical examiner barbara sampson ruled epstein’s cause of death to be a suicide by hanging new york medical examiner jeffrey epsteins death was a suicide by hanging “it appears that this could have been a mistake” baden said “there’s evidence here of homicide that should be investigated to see if it is or isn’t homicide” but sampson on wednesday is standing by her findings “our investigation concluded that the cause of mr epstein’s death was hanging and the manner of death was suicide we stand by that determination she told fox news in a statement we continue to share information around the medical investigation with mr epsteins family their representatives and their pathology consultant the original medical investigation was thorough and complete she continued adding that there is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office” epstein previously was discovered on july 23 over two weeks before his death on the floor of his prison cell with marks around his neck after which he was placed on suicide watch he was taken off suicide watch a week later and put in another cell with a roommate baden said but the second inmate was taken out a few days after that leaving epstein alone in the cell jeffrey epsteins former excop cellmate at nyc lockup must have better living conditions judge rules on the day epstein was found dead the prison security had experienced a “total breakdown” in procedure according to baden “it was determined that the two guards who were supposed to be working in that area of the prison had allegedly fallen asleep and hadn’t made their 30minute rounds for more than 3 hours” he said jail where jeffrey epstein died has egregious history of security breaches then there were security cameras that were supposed to be recording the cell and the hallway outside to see who went in and out both apparently had malfunctioned according to baden mark epstein jeffrey’s next of kin had hired baden to perform an independent investigation because the family wasn’t getting answers and if his brother’s death was in fact a homicide “he and others may be at risk” baden said “because of somebody not wanting knowledge given out” click here to get the fox news app through his five decades of experience epstein’s death is not straightforward baden said “it doesn’t give you the answer he said its not a typical hanging case” fox news greg norman contributed to this report

The evidence suggests otherwise.,https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/10/biden-harris-tax-plan-median-household-will-pay-more/,Beliavsky,585,146,the biden campaign says only the rich will pay more under his tax plan the evidence suggests otherwise no one can doubt that joe biden plans to raise taxes on households earning over 400000 the question is how the bidenharris tax plan if implemented would affect households earning less than 400000 on cue during last wednesday’s debate senator harris and vice president pence sparred over the subject the answer most households would face a tax increase under the bidenharris tax plan in fact as the chart shows unless your household income is less than 45600 there is more than a 90 percent chance that the bidenharris plan if enacted will raise your taxes in the exact middle of the household income distribution over 95 percent of households can expect a tax increase if the bidenharris plan becomes law overall 826 percent of american households can expect a tax increase advertisement these estimates come from the penn wharton budget model at the university of pennsylvania’s wharton school of business not exactly a friend of president trump’s economic agenda when i was at president trump’s white house council of economic advisers in fact we explicitly criticized the penn wharton budget model’s estimates of the effects of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act if the penn wharton budget model produces estimates inconvenient for the bidenharris agenda then they’re likely to be inconvenient truths not results of cherrypicked assumptions these estimates — produced in march 2020 as part of an analysis of the bidenharris tax agenda — were updated in september 2020 with a comprehensive look at the entire bidenharris economic agenda the “updated” analysis however did not include estimates specifically of how many households in each income quintile faced tax increases at least none that the public can see advertisement by all indications however there is no reason to expect march 2020’s numbers on households facing tax hikes under the bidenharris plan to have changed by september 2020 the specific provisions that drove these estimates in march 2020 were still there in september the numbers also it seems line up in march they estimated that the plan would raise between 31 and 37 trillion in revenue over 10 years in september they estimated that the plan over 10 years would raise 34 trillion — the exact midpoint that represents the average of 31 and 37 trillion at the quintile level penn wharton changed its verbiage for describing average tax hikes between march and september so far as i can discern red from orange and compare apples to apples however the tax hikes for each quintile in september’s analysis are within a tenth of a percentage point of what was reported in march so what’s under the hood of september’s estimate appears moreorless identical to what was there in march doubt tends to be the natural response to statistics that surprise but if these numbers surprise you your natural doubt may here lead you astray a chasm between public perception and reality on tax policy according the new york times emerged during president trump’s first term “if you’re an american taxpayer you probably got a tax cut last year and there’s a good chance you don’t believe it” ben casselman and jim tankersley economics journalists at the times wrote in april 2019 about the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act “to a large degree the gap between perception and reality on the tax cuts appears to flow from a sustained — and misleading — effort by liberal opponents of the law” they conclude advertisement now vice president joe biden is campaigning on a repeal of the legislation that produced a broad middleclass tax cut he like many who told you that the 2017 legislation didn’t cut your taxes now claims this repeal won’t raise your taxes now then it seems vice president biden and senator harris are lying about the likely effects of their tax plan as the saying goes “fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me” don’t be fooled a second time

grouptorrance daily breeze via getty images tara reade says joe biden once grabbed her privates and demanded sex will that change the election in november the brett kavanaugh supreme court hearings were a turning point when the presumption of innocence was thrown out in favor of a new standard “credible accusation” evidence was replaced by believeallwomen praised by dems and the media as fierce justice then it’s biden’s turn now imagine the same type of proceedings directed at him amy klobuchar repeats her accusation that kavanaugh er biden is a drunk with about as little evidence now as then senator dick durbin demands biden demand an fbi investigation into himself durbin says of biden as he did of kavanaugh that if he has nothing to hide then he has nothing to fear a line often attributed to joseph goebbels kamala harris goes in as bad cop righteously shouting down whatever is said to her by biden the truth you can’t handle the truth after that show imagine a second one where elizabeth warren longshot biden vp pick florida representative val demings kirsten gillibrand stacey abrams and michigan governor gretchen whitmer all show up to stand by biden not believe reade andor remain silent when asked watching people force themselves to support biden under these conditions is what i imagine the beach boys looked like backstage trying to mix viagra and meth so they could get through “surfin’ usa” one more time to flesh things out voters could call in to ask those democratic leaders how the very serious business of metoo got turned into just another political tool by the “party of women” alyssa milano whose take on the kavanaugh hearings was that she believed all women without the need for due process could be brought out to explain how now “the notion that this should be disqualifying to biden in a race against trump is patently ridiculous anybody who claims otherwise is using sexual assault as a political football” well yes that is the point dems made sexual assault a political football problem is now they find themselves on defense for the first time having successfully ignored in 2016 bill clinton’s handson approach one article does what i just don’t have the breath to bother with pull up exact quotes of what was said about kavanaugh and his accuser and compare it to what is being said about biden and reade it’d be fun to do the same with the anita hillclarence thomas hearings unveiled is the total hypocrisy of metoo and how selfrighteous dems are when these techniques are used by them rather than against them meanwhile more and more women are realizing that democratic hypocrisy is setting back women’s rights harassment and assault are useful and valid only as political weapons victims only of use to tee up a media storm the impact on the election will be… sorry i just can’t do it again it’s the same thing over and over isn’t it obvious isn’t the false narrative plain and isn’t it likely that yet again very few people care the pattern is beyond obvious the addition of new player joe biden the only change i can’t get away from it people believe what they want to instead of writing about tara reade i started writing a story on politico‘s fully debunked claim that trump was beholden to the bank of china because of some loan that one fell apart faster then i could type it up same for a story on how the fbi set up michael flynn in an obvious perjury trap too many believe the democrats and msm when they tell us these things they are all wrong so why is anyone believing them now i am tired of being lied to i am

Pandemic,https://www.theepochtimes.com/democrats-would-rather-blame-trump-than-china-for-the-pandemic_3309825.html,Foubar,579,136,house speaker rep nancy pelosi dcalif speaks to the press at the capitol in washington on march 27 2020 alex edelmanafp via getty images democrats would rather blame trump than china for the pandemic commentary i have written before that we’re in the midst of two pandemics the medical pandemic caused by the ccp virus and a political pandemic largely instigated by the democratic party and its myriad media allies the medical pandemic may hopefully be easing but the political pandemic appears to be going into overdrive the democrats and the media are now more interested in blaming trump rather than the chinese communists for covid19 this is particularly dangerous since the chinese communist party ccp has been engaged for weeks now in a propaganda campaign blaming the united states for the virus the accusations are absurd but as with much propaganda people will start to believe it if they hear it enough further the chinese have begun to engage in an academic coverup of the provenance of the virus erasing online scientific papers from their university websites fudan university and the china university of geosciences in wuhan so that suspicious traces are gone and scientific history can be rewritten in orwellian fashion bat experiments what bat experiments by focusing their attention on trump the democrats are in essence aiding the ccp in its nefarious activities which could well do immense damage to the future of our country and the world but never mind trump must go two early harbingers of this trend were the accusations of “xenophobia” and “racism” by former vice president joe biden and others when the president closed the door on travel from china and house speaker nancy pelosi consequently urging everyone to join the throngs in chinatown for chinese new year nothing could go wrong naturally they also attacked trump for not paying attention to the virus while they were impeaching him as if they were when in those nauseating days of the impeachment trial at the end of january and the beginning of february did you hear even one word from a democrat about a chinese virus this line of attack has been especially repellent considering the exceptionally flimsy possibly even corrupt basis of the accusation itself and then there was the politicization of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine because the president recommended it as worth at least a try to most media and dems it was as if trump were shilling for strychnine that it actually worked in many instances was beside the point and not to be reported or even admitted or as ann coulter put it on twitter “breaking ‘president trump knew for weeks that the drug hydroxychloroquine could have saved millions but did nothing’ — the new york times 1 month from now’” one of the more recent methods being employed to tarnish trump during the pandemic is the deification of national institute of allergy and infectious diseases director anthony fauci the press and the dems treat him as a combination of two alberts—schweizer and einstein in reality though a competent scientist fauci has made his share of errors already regarding the ccp virus at first naively accepting the communists’ lie that the virus could only be passed by animals to man and therefore downplaying the epidemic in general he has also made his fair share of mistakes regarding the numbers affected that seem to change virtually daily always downward but whatever you think of fauci the dem’s and the media’s objective is clearly to drive a wedge between trump and the scientists to make the president seem like a greedy yahoo willing to sacrifice his fellow citizens for the good of the stock market that it’s trump’s job as our elected leader not the scientists’ to figure out how to balance the reaction to the pandemic between health and economic issues the latter having serious health implications of their own is irrelevant that “elected leader” phrase is the root of most of this the dems notably their liberal wing have little left to say liberalism is moribund as barton swaim pointed out well in this weekend’s wall street journal its important achievements now decades old but like all political parties they still want power and biden represents the past in every way imaginable all they really have for generating excitement is how they can paint trump so they continue to turn him into the enemy now even to the extent of excusing and defending the real enemy communist china this should be alarming to our nation and the world roger l simon—the epoch times’ senior political columnist—is also an awardwinning novelist and an academy awardnominated

nations no recourse but to push back hard no longer can responsible nations tolerate the regime’s destabilizing interference around the world postcovid19 there will be a new world map and this is what it is going to look like cartography in modern times let’s start with what the map doesn’t look like there won’t be big bold circles blue and red demarking spheres of influence and control this isn’t like most other great power competitions from “inter caetera” to the cold war for one the us is a global power with global interests and responsibilities washington isn’t going to cede any part of the world to beijing conversely china’s reach is worldwide no one is going to stop doing business with china least of all the united states china doesn’t have a hammerlock on any part of the world other than north korea and a handful of southeast asian countries and beijing may find it can’t keep those countries under its thumb forever disputes over the mekong river in southeast asia for example may open wedges for countries seeking a more independent line from beijing if the us and north korea ever reach a nuclear deal that could break beijing’s monopoly as well china of course has fast friends elsewhere but partnerships with russia iran venezuela cuba and the like are of marginal benefit at best all of these countries are embroiled in competitions of their own which have left them politically and economically isolated from various parts of the world other than comradeship diplomatic support and a modicum of trade they have little to offer each other mostly these are partnerships of convenience not real strategic alliances in particular the oftdiscussed threat of beijing and moscow teaming up is way overblown nor does it appear there will be an appreciable postcold war version of the “nonaligned movement” indeed all the traditional leaders of this cause particularly india seem busy trying to align themselves in one way or another new global boundaries the vast majority of the world is and will remain for the foreseeable future divided into three camps 1 the free world resilient against chinese meddling 2 the balancers nations that recognize the key to their prosperity and security is engaging with both the united states and china protecting their independence and minimizing the likelihood that they will become theaters of competition between great powers and 3 contested space where the us china and others compete for influence across the spectrum of economic political security and information spheres the free world this is a term that is going to make a big comeback there is a defining difference between the united states and the chinese communist party america believes in economic freedom human rights and popular sovereignty the chinese communist party does not countries that want to preserve the place of free peoples will have to pick a side—and they likely will uscanadamexico the hemispheric triad is the base of american power the prosperity economies infrastructure security and as we have now seen public health of these three countries are intertwined don’t count on china making any major inroads here the newly implemented uscanadamexico free trade agreement further cemented the three economies together while trump’s relationships with trudeau and amlo is often depicted as dysfunctional in practice cooperation has never been better in particular the us and mexico have implemented unprecedented cooperation on immigration and border security the us will likely provide significant assistance to mexico in battling the covid19 outbreak it will do little good to get american factories up and running if parts manufacturers for these companies in mexico are shut down battling the coronavirus in addition as more us companies look to move manufacturing partnerships out of china more of that business is likely to go to mexico transatlantic community no strategic partnership is more important to the free world than the transatlantic community the us isn’t going to give up on this partnership neither should europe if europeans want to keep their freedoms they can’t be neutral observers in the competition between the us and china even switzerland can’t be switzerland anymore postcovid expect renewed investments in the transatlantic community not just to restart our joint economic engine but to marginalize the malicious influences of china the middle east china will never supplant us influence and importance in this region if anything right now washington has an opportunity to expand its influence and establish a sustainable footprint for contributing to peace stability and prosperity in the greater middle east postcovid19 they key to that is putting a security political and economic architecture in place the indopacific one of the positive developments of the covid19 outbreak is that it has facilitated cooperation among the “the quadplus” group in fashioning a response the united states along with india japan south korea australia new zealand vietnam and taiwan offer a formidable diplomatic framework for bringing peace and prosperity to this part of the world in the face of china’s bullying influence life in balance there will be many countries including some respectable democracies that for one reason or another won’t or can’t stand up to beijing the key to their independence security and prosperity won’t be to limit china’s presence but to engage with the us and others to balance chinese influence this is a path that will be followed by places like singapore sri lanka nepal bhutan bangladesh thailand djibouti pakistan serbia and others china might not like to see the presence of other powers in these places but these relationships should be perfectly acceptable to the united states the us doesn’t need every country to pick sides what we should and do want is for these countries to insist that—for their own interests as well as ours—external powers play fair that is why for example the us japan and others promote the blue dot network which promotes quality transparent and economically viable international infrastructure projects if anything expect the ranks of these countries to expand mongolia and several central asian countries are looking to move in that direction the arctic and antarctic regions are both areas where china would like to have a lot more sway that is not going to happen either from economic and environmental perspectives these regions must remain areas of open cooperation not competition the peoples of the region and the planet will only benefit if these areas remain places of mutual cooperation the us will have to be part of a joint effort to curb china’s unreasonable arctic ambitions likewise washington will have to play a leadership role in protecting the antarctic the competition zone the us and china are going to duke it out for influence in vast swaths of the world—latin america africa the pacific islands—as well as in international organizations america has a homefield advantage in the western hemisphere the trump administration has done a far better job in partnering with latin american and caribbean nations than many expected still there is much to be done the us was slow to wake up to what china was up to in africa and the pacific islands and washington is still in catchup mode the great challenge for the us is not lack of will but often the lack responsible partners to work with in many cases poor governance inadequate transparency insufficient accountability and a lack of economic freedom are hindrances to forming effective partnerships one of the most active new battlegrounds for us and chinese influence will be international organizations china has been aggressively trying to expand its influence over the key organizations that regulate global norms the us is fighting uphill on this one too sketching out the future there are those who want to ignore the competition with china others wish to cut ties completely and then divide the world up into ours and theirs both will be sadly disappointed by the world’s new map the map lays out many challenges for the us but also reveals both our significant advantages and opportunities postcovid19 washington needs to pay a lot more attention to the demands that the new map maps out after we get our economy up and running dealing with china will no doubt be job one a heritage foundation vice president james jay carafano directs the think tank’s research on matters of national security and foreign relations

Decades",https://www.yahoo.com/news/madison-cawthorn-wins-election-becomes-030157610.html,Havvocck2,581,79,national review lew wallace the former territorial governor of new mexico and author of ben hur once said “every calculation based on experience elsewhere fails in new mexico”in so many ways wallace was prescient about this beautiful poor and unique state in the american southwest one “calculation” about modern politics that would especially perplex him is the fact that a relatively poor but oilrich western state elects politicians that are so directly at odds with its economic best interestafter texas and north dakota new mexico is the thirdlargest oilproducing state in the us the oil and gas industries combine to generate roughly 40 percent of its annual budget furthermore new mexico’s oil and gas resources are heavily concentrated on lands managed by the federal government the central role of energy especially energy extracted within the state’s borders and controlled by federal policymakers might lead one to believe that new mexicans would vote for proenergy republicans in federal electionsinstead new mexico has become a safely blue state it narrowly went for george w bush in 2004 but since then has gone for democrats by wide margins the situation is even more stark at the state level where democrats have had “trifectas” total control of both houses and the governor’s mansion for 60 of the past 90 years the gop hasn’t had such governing authority in the state for a single year since 1931 and despite significant turnover has not elected a republican to the us senate since pete domenici retired in 2009in 2020 biden won the state 543 percent to 435 percent despite the fact that president trump’s proenergy policies have been a boon to the new mexico economy and that the biden administration’s energy policies are a dagger aimed at the heart of new mexico’s economythat “dagger” comes in the form of the numerous sometimes clear often conflicting statements that candidate biden made during the campaign it is unclear what biden will do about hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” which enables oil and gas producers to access previously inaccessible oil and gas sources he backed away from an outright nationwide ban late in the campaign however biden has clearly stated that he would ban new gas and oil permits including fracking on federal landstargeting federal lands would devastate new mexico’s oil and gas industry and its economy because of the state’s large federal estate according to the institute for energy research 347 percent of the land in new mexico is federal in fiscal year 2019 new mexico received energyrelated disbursement from the federal bureau of land management of 117 billion the highest payment made in any state wyoming was next with 641 million and then colorado with 108 million this was the highest payment from the bureau in the state’s history and compares with 455 million in fy 2017 a vast majority of this increased revenue is a result of frackingfurthermore data from the global energy institute indicate that if energy production on federal lands were banned new mexico would lose 24300 jobs 10000 direct 14300 indirect and induced a significant hit for a state with a workforce of around 900000 making matters worse a good number of the “direct” jobs lost are goodpaying something that is not easy to find in new mexico a state that consistently ranks among the poorest in the nation and has been hardhit by the covid19 pandemic closing new mexico’s federal lands to energy production entirely would cost the state 496 million in annual royalty collections representing 8 percent of the state’s total general fund revenuesbiden’s proposed fracking ban is even too much for new mexico’s democratic governor michelle lujan grisham who has said that she’ll ask for an exemption from any future drilling ban acknowledging the taxrevenue contributions to education funding grisham explained to the new mexico oil and gas association conference in santa fe last october that “without the energy effort in this state no one gets to make education the top priority”to be sure lujan grisham is broadly supportive of biden’s energy policies she’s even on the presidentelect’s short list for administration positions both of them have stated that they would like to “transition out of fossil fuels” despite new mexico’s financial dependence on the industrybut biden’s aggressive antifossilfuels stance as it relates to federal land not only puts him at odds with lujan grisham it puts him far to the left of president obama on the issue in a 2012 presidential debate obama stated “we’ve opened up public lands we’re actually drilling more on public lands than the previous administration and natural gas isn’t just appearing magically we’re encouraging it and working with the industry”president obama was of course considered an environmentalist by political opponents and supporters alike his support for naturalgas right isn’t difficult to reconcile with his environmental track record that’s because when used in a new power plants natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less co2 than a typical new coal plantobama understood the vast benefits of natural gas including the fact that it was appropriate to drill for it on federal lands during his tenure naturalgas production rose some 35 percent from approximately 21 million cubic feet to more than 284 million cubic feetif he truly cares about the environment biden would be wise to follow his predecessor’s playbook according to the epa us net greenhousegas emissions went down by 10 percent from 2005 to 2018 and much of the contribution to that decline in recent years was “due to an increasing shift to use of less carbon dioxideintensive natural gas for generating electricity and a rapid increase in the use of renewable energy in the electric power sector” but if naturalgas prices rise and a ban on federal leasing is likely to contribute to higher prices these positive developments could go into reverse the energy information administration recently projected that higher naturalgas prices would cause coal’s share of power generation to increase from 18 percent to 22 percent in 2021obama also signed into law legislation that ended the us government’s restrictions on crudeoil exports back in 2015during the campaign biden faced tremendous pressure from the left wing of his political base to come out for policies such the green new deal and bans on fracking and other fossilfuelbased energy production biden has never been associated with such hardleft stances against economic policy and growth in the past remember even obama is to the right of where biden campaignedlets hope that president biden has a more realistic approach to energy than did candidate biden new mexico’s economic future is certainly at stake but so is the recovery of our nation’s virushobbled economyrather than instituting a blanket ban on production of oil and gas on federal lands a better approach would be to recognize the benefits and work to make sure that any production is handled responsibly and safely the growing american energy sector and american energy independence have delivered wins for the environment for consumers and for the us and state economies such as new mexico’s let’s keep it that way

Apart,https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/05/how-lefts-normalization-collective-guilt-ripping-america-apart/,Foubar,583,155,all decent americans stand against racism but if we’re to live as brothers we must stop indicting all those who share a skin tone for the sins of others i was nowhere near the intersection of chicago avenue and 38th street when george floyd tragically lost his life i wasn’t in minnesota i was more than 500 miles away with the exception of the officers at that heartbreaking scene there are more than 329 million additional americans who had no part in that terrible evening so why are so many people acting as if it were their knee not derek chauvin’s that pressed down on george floyd the answer lies in the concerted effort of radical leftists and their unwitting accomplices to normalize the collectivization of guilt the great guilting it’s nothing entirely new in 1980 howard zinn and his marxist ahistorical and repugnant textbook “a peoples history of the united states” began mainstreaming the idea that caucasians bore collective guilt for all of america’s past sins by securing the blessings of the academic intelligentsia he had support in the most valuable places thankfully zinn didn’t have modernday social media at his disposal one shudders to think how wide zinn’s reach could have been with a few million followers on twitter instagram or facebook but if you’ve looked around the social media landscape recently you’ve witnessed the unleashing of a radical movement beyond his wildest dreams leftist influencers have convinced millions of americans that the only way they will be allowed in polite society the only way they will be perceived as decent is if they accept culpability for floyd’s death and the “systemically racist society” they apparently helped create the radical left demands caucasians apologize for their “privilege” they must read internalize and publicly praise books on approved reading lists in order to come to grips with their “unconscious” and deepseated racism they must shop at blackowned businesses on sites like webuyblackcom theblackwalletcom and shoppeblackus as further proof of their solidarity but is there much doubt that if the color was changed from “black” to “white” that the southern poverty law center wouldn’t label these sites sources of hate on june 2 instagram was flooded with people posting pictures of black boxes in support of black lives matter activists quickly however an evergrowing list of “suggestions” muddled the “rules” of who should post and in what manner was pleasing to the blackout tuesday folks actress and feminist activist emma watson was attacked on twitter for both posting the boxes and for taking so long you can’t win branded for the sins of others it is always good to remind people not to be racist—though it is doubtful just how much reminding is needed between the legacy media television and movies all constantly promoting that message what’s sad is that so many good utterly nonracist americans feel if they don’t go through the “approved” steps they’ll be roped together with actual white supremacists not to be left out businesses from coffee chains to game developers also feel they must denounce what we have always known to be evil namely the unwarranted taking of another human life it would be ridiculous and unjust to blame a 20yearold russian for the heinous atrocities committed by joseph stalin more than 70 years ago it would still be unjust to blame a 90yearold woman who lived in the soviet union while stalin was alive for the millions who died under his tyrannical rule according to crime statistics compiled by the fbi and the us department of justice 2925 black americans were murdered in 2018 the details show that 88 percent of the perpetrators of these homicides were black themselves yet no logical honest person would blame all black americans for these deaths to do so would throw blood onto innocent hands the radical left however has been attempting this sort of collectivization of guilt with renewed vigor ever since the new york times published its first “1619 project” essays in august 2019 a natural extension of the 1619 project the 1619 project isn’t about making you feel contempt and anger for those who brought the first black slaves from africa to virginia four centuries ago it’s about making all caucasians and all westerners feel as if they piloted the slave ships themselves its main thesis—and heinous lie—is that america is an irredeemably vile nation conceived in sin in a disturbing example of the confluence of the 1619 project and modern corporate guilttripping ben jerry’s issued a statement that reads like an updated version of the radical port huron manifesto—only it’s angrier and more incendiary what does an ice cream company have to do with any of this you’re not allowed to ask sit down and take your medicine “the murder of george floyd” the dairy brothers proclaim “was the result of inhumane police brutality that is perpetuated by a culture of white supremacy what happened to george floyd was not the result of a bad apple it was the predictable consequence of a racist and prejudiced system and culture that has treated black bodies as the enemy from the beginning” then to prove their outrage bona fides they go for the gold and tag 1619 for the finisher “what happened to george floyd in minneapolis is the fruit borne of toxic seeds planted on the shores of our country in jamestown in 1619 when the first enslaved men and women arrived on this continent” the statement closes by calling on “white america” to “collectively acknowledge its privilege” and “take responsibility for its past” of the host of problems with the screed published by ben jerry’s is that even if it were legitimate for americans to “take responsibility” for all of the nation’s past sins not only is it functionally impossible to do so but radical leftists aren’t interested that’s not the point the point is to keep the anger machine firing on all cylinders that’s the only way they get the permanent revolution they’re after unlike the sin that man commits to his fellow man for the authors of the 1619 project there is no hope for forgiveness no chance for reconciliation no way to atone if as the 1619 advocates claim the seeds are toxic and the tree is poisonous then the only thing left to do is burn it all down nikole hannahjones the author of the lead 1619 essay recently told cbs news “destroying property which can be replaced is not violence” while all americans are indeed created equal pulitzer prizes are clearly not rebuilding brotherhood—one brother at a time americans want to stand with those peacefully protesting injustice but the radical left offers either the choice of selfcondemnation for evils americans had no hand in or to be silent and stay that way if the second option is chosen that very silence is viewed as an indictment of “complicity” often seen by the left as akin to violence itself ultimately that’s no choice at all it now appears that minneapolis policeman derek chauvin will be charged with seconddegree murder justice will be served and chauvin will be tried by a judge and jury of his peers if the court finds him guilty the penalty—40 years in prison—will be harsh but fair it is horrible it is sad and it is tragic but george floyd will not be the last man to die at the hands of law enforcement the next time a life is lost to an abuse of police power it must be denounced once again and the perpetrators subjected to our civilized courts of trial deliberation and justice but we need to start finally viewing each other as individuals responsible for our actions and our actions alone every day we each commit personal acts of vice virtue and all shades in between as individual men and women we bear the guilt and reap the penalties for our own sins and crimes as individual men and women we earn praise for righteous behavior this nation isn’t just built on freedom and equality central to the american experience is the chance for a new life and with it redemption if we surrender that we’ll be left with far too much anger and hatred and we won’t like what follows
hm8mcu,2020-07-06 17:27:47,Republican,An Old White Professor Speaks to the Class of 2020 - A dose of reality for those who think they can change the world simply by following woke causes.,https://spectator.org/old-white-professor-speaks-class-of-2020-protests-revolution/,Foubar,574,64,nearly every graduation speaker tells the graduates that they are going to change the country profoundly and irrevocably don’t worry you won’t for the most part that’s a good thing while america is not without its policies that cry for change there is much that is good about america that has become impolitic to speak about — especially at graduations there is no perfect economic system capitalism is not evil crony capitalism is for the last four years you haven’t had a course in civics but you did have a course in social studies taught by people who believe that america is a racist sexist homophobic society that possesses a fascist political culture so think a moment did any of these teachers get fired for such words did they go home looking over their shoulders worried about whether the secret police were going to knock on their door did they contemplate making a dangerous journey and trying to sneak into mexico or canada you see in a real fascist culture you cannot criticize the regime and stay out of prison or stay alive as the old joke of my generation goes in america everyone is always looking for a party in russia the party is always looking for you your generation thinks you have discovered the evils of racism and discrimination and that both are uniquely western institutions let me burst your bubble there are few societies if any that have not practiced slavery and more white people have been enslaved by north africans than africans by white people in 1785 thomas jefferson and john adams negotiated with tripoli’s envoy to london ambassador sidi haji abdrahaman over the enslavement of americans they asked abdrahaman what right he had to seize slaves he replied that his right was “founded on the laws of the prophet that it was written in their koran” but if your teachers were to teach about that — assuming they would want to — political outrage and cries of islamophobia would ensue and they would be cowed into submission two african kings tegesibu of dahomey and alvarez of the congo numbered among the richest men in the world in the early 18th century their wealth came from providing slaves to the portuguese slavery is evil in all its manifestations whether the horror of the middle passage the north african slave raids on italy or the ottoman forays into the slavic countries the word itself comes from the muslims of andalusia spain taking slaves from among eastern european slavic peoples and while your generation is marching protesting and calling for revolution because of the remnants of racism in this society you need to be reminded that black chattel slavery in all its ugly forms is still alive and well in libya in the 21st century so when you say that racism and slavery are uniquely western institutions you are not simply wrong you are pathetically ignorant many generations have a revolution fantasy i saw the barriers go up in seattle and thought of berkeley’s telegraph avenue in the 1960s when people from my generation went to cuba under the auspices of the venceremos brigade and sat around the campfires talking to the heroes of the revolution about urban guerrilla warfare in america the veterans of the campaign against fulgencio batista laughed your paris commune fantasy in seattle like the weatherman days of rage of the 1960s inflicted pain suffering and death but it was not the route to change these puerile and egotistical ideas of revolution will mobilize the great silent majority who abhor black lives matter but are too intimidated to speak out against an organization rooted in racism and antisemitism you see class of 2020 the most important political concept is legitimacy for all its flaws the american system is viewed as not only legitimate but one that also offers a nonviolent means to change so when you block the emergency room of the local hospital and then justify it by saying white people have blocked black people for 400 years you are destroying your own legitimacy with a rationale that is as stupid as it is reprehensible don’t be swayed by what you see on tv about marches or hear from woke business leaders trying to do damage control or cash in on the symbolism of black lives matter as you pampered potential marxists play with your cell phones at graduation waiting to return home in your own automobiles eager to zoom with your friends what you don’t know is that it’s not a revolution being televised but a political orgy of fun and profit the word “revolution” means to return back to the point of origin after the french revolution and decades of war and upheaval the monarchy passed from louis xvi to louis xviii and then to charles x or as the french might say plus ça change plus c’est la même chose the russians would say that communism is the longest road from capitalism back to capitalism if you want to change the system join the system because in america revolution — like urban guerrilla warfare — is a childish fantasy america has flaws but it is still a strong legitimate democracy with a vital political center that has always abhorred violence as a political instrument be grateful for what you have and embrace a system that offers opportunities for change if you were taught that revolution is the way to change the system you need to contact the bursar’s office and demand a refund for a meaningless education abraham h miller is an emeritus professor of political science university of cincinnati and

claim",https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/04/men-disadvantaged-women-uk-us-europe-scientists-claim-8309361/,PoliticsThrowawayAcc,577,118,scientists have invented a new way of measuring gender equality and claimed it shows men are more disadvantaged than women in most developed countries researchers from the university of missouri and university of essex in the united kingdom said previous ways of measuring inequality are ‘biased to highlight women’s issues’ their basic index of gender inequality bigi instead measures three factors educational opportunities healthy life expectancy and overall life satisfaction the academics calculated scores for 134 nations and used the results to suggest men are more disadvantaged than women in 91 nations feminist activists protesting against donald trump they discovered that the most developed nations in the world came ‘closest to achieving gender equality albeit with a slight advantage for women’ advertisement advertisement however in the least developed countries women fall behind men because they don’t have access to education using the index bahrain was named as the top nation for gender equality followed by the uk and the netherlands the us was ranked in position 34 with men falling behind in education as well as life expectancy and satisfaction most european countries with the exception of italy were deemed to be better for women than men equality in the uk ‘gender inequality great britain has a relatively low level of gender inequality gender differences in life satisfaction are negligible men fall somewhat behind in years of secondary education while they fall more than 33 behind in healthy life expectancy 70 years for men and 72 years for women in the 20122016 period ‘how to improve most potential for improvement lies in the area of healthy life expectancy currently great britain has a national health strategy for women but not for men creating a national health strategy for men has the potential to make a real difference the knowledge and skills needed to run a genderspecific health strategy are available in great britain further a greater focus on the education gap is needed the bigi only looks at years of education but the reality is that boys do not achieve as well as girls in the time they attend school this starts already in preschool’ “with the bigi we are focusing on issues that are important to all women and men in any nation regardless of level of economic and political development and by including factors that can disadvantage men as well as women’ said david geary who is curators’ distinguished professor of psychological sciences in the mu college of arts and science ‘current equality measures are generally biased to highlight women’s issues and thus are not really measures of gender equality’ ‘we calculated bigi scores for 134 nations representing 68 billion people ‘surprisingly our new measure indicated that men are on average more disadvantaged than women in 91 countries compared with a relative disadvantage for women in 43 countries ‘we sought to correct the bias toward women’s issues in existing measures and at the same time develop a simple measure that is useful in any country in the world regardless of their level of economic development’ gender equality in the us equality in the us ‘gender inequality given its wealth and very high level of human development its bigi score is surprisingly low men fall behind in all three bigi indicators in regard to healthy life expectancy the gap is nearly 5 68 years for men and 71 years for women in the 20122016 period ‘how to improve initiatives focusing on men’s access to or use of health care as well as those focusing on boys’ education and health might help to address the current inequalities’ the new measure has thrown up some strange results for instance it rated saudi arabia as having a high level of ‘gender parity’ which suggests men and women live reasonably equal lives this is because of a 7 disadvantage for women in education and a 5 disadvantage for men in life satisfaction but in 2016 the world economic forum’s global gender gap report placed saudi arabia at a dismal 141 out of 144 countries for gender parity the researchers said the gravest disadvantage facing men was often heath particularly in countries with high levels of alcohol consumption which tends to lower men’s lifespan for women the disadvantages are strongly related to education ‘no existing measure of gender inequality fully captures the hardships that are disproportionately experienced by men and so they do not fully capture the extent to which any nation is promoting the wellbeing of all its citizens’ said gijsbert stoet professor of psychology at the university of essex advertisement advertisement ‘the bigi provides a much simpler way of tackling gender inequality and it focuses on aspects of life that are directly relevant to all people ‘internationally improvements in gender parity may be reached by focusing on education in the least developed nations and by focusing on preventative health care in medium and highly developed nations’ advertisement advertisement

forward always forward for a better america for an endless enduring dream and a thousand points of light this is my mission and i will complete it” applause this phrase “a thousand points of light” spoke to who george herbert walker bush really was his life was devoted to public service to public duty bush was a navy pilot during world war ii a member of congress the us ambassador to the united nations the first american envoy to the people’s republic of china the director of the cia and for eight years vice president of the united states “one tiny sweet potato and a little bit of corn good to see you fellas” it’s often said that george bush was probably the most successful oneterm president we’ve had in american history certainly in modern times he led the united states through the first truly successful military engagement since vietnam presided over the fall of the berlin wall “and some believe that the weight of history condemned our two great countries” and eventually the collapse of the soviet union here was george bush — had just won the gulf war just won the cold war — and we threw him out of power george bush came from a political family his father prescott bush had served in the united states senate he went to school at andover and yale the idea that he was too genteel you know new england restrained kind of dogged him baseball actually kind of helped define his life he believed in being a good sport playing with honor and competing george bush was one of the fiercest competitors you’ll ever meet but he interrupted his education in order to go volunteer for service in world war ii he was the youngest navy pilot “carrier pilots could scarcely wait for this chance to close with the japanese fleet” fighting in the pacific he was shot down rescued by a submarine after returning from the war bush married his teenage sweetheart barbara pierce and the two of them set off for a new life together in texas he created his own oil company made some money for himself and started a family he was on the road a lot he came home as often as he could and he’s somebody who cherished family he was a friend builder he would just sort of show up at dinner time with somebody he had met that day and barbara would have to sort of like add three seats to the table and that was the essence of bush’s politics it was all about making friends bringing people together trying to reconcile different political viewpoints “i know you and i share a lot of worries about the future of our state and nation” in those days most texans were still democrats conservative democrats but democrats “i hope to have support from all segments of society and i’m sure campaigning hard in all areas” george bush was part of a new generation of republicans who were trying to convert it bush ran for president in 1980 and while he won the iowa caucuses he ended up falling to ronald reagan in the end though he did well enough that reagan put him on the ticket as his vice presidential running mate “… which i am about to enter” “so help you god” “so help me god” “god bless you george” in 1988 he ran for president against michael dukakis in what was for then seen as a particularly tough and sometimes nasty race “he allowed firstdegree murderers to have a weekend passes” democrats thought that the campaign relied on racebaiting but in the end bush prevailed over dukakis to become the first sitting vice president elected to the white house since martin van buren “america is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle” george bush believed in this kinder gentler vision of america and he wanted to work across the aisle “let me just welcome the members of congress who’ve done so much” it didn’t always happen but he made common cause with democrats on a variety of issues whether it be the environment civil rights or foreign policy bush was sort of viewed as kind of a kindly mildmannered uncle in a way mocked by some of the comics like dana carvey who impersonated him on “saturday night live” “got out there on that water got in that relaxation mode recharge the batteries” and yet — “astonishing news from east germany where the east german authorities have said in essence that the berlin wall doesn’t mean anything anymore” “today was the beginning of the end of what they called the wall of shame” — he had a backbone of steel “there’s a new development in this rapidly changing part of the world that we can salute” he was criticized for not celebrating more when the berlin wall fell but for bush that wouldn’t have been prudent “you don’t seem elated and i’m wondering if you’re thinking —” “i’m elated i’m just not an emotional kind of guy” he didn’t want to rub mikhail gorbachev’s nose in it he wanted to make sure that it was not a moment that could provoke a backlash by hardliners in the soviet union his foreign policy experience proved to be exactly what was needed at a critical moment in world history “just two hours ago allied air forces began an attack on military targets in iraq and kuwait” the gulf war was the defining moment of his presidency all of those years spent making friends proved to be the skill he needed to assemble an international coalition of dozens of countries to repel iraq from kuwait the idea that you could let a problem fester in the world a dictator like saddam hussein went against the grain for him and that was founded in his days in world war ii the war proved to be a giant boost for bush politically poll numbers went up to nearly 90 percent the highest that it ever been to that point for any president and yet — “there’s more bad reelection news for president bush” — he would go on to lose reelection just a year or so later when the economy took a downward turn “but how does it affected you and if you have no experience in it how can you help us if you don’t know what we’re feeling” many americans thought he cared more about what was happening overseas than in their own communities devastated as he was by the defeat — “i just called governor clinton over in little rock and offered my congratulations” — he invited dana carvey to come to the white house and do an impersonation of bush to the staff to kind of cheer them up “the way to do the president is to start out with mr rogers then you add a little john wayne here we go let’s go over the ridge you put them together you got george herbert walker bush” that’s a real sign of who george bush was he had a sense of humor he was a strong leader who steered the country through difficult times and came out leaving it in much better shape than he found it in his time of course democrats were really upset at him they thought he was unfair to michael dukakis he was seen as a tool by some of the oil industry but over time these criticisms tended to fade people in both parties had come to see him as a model of what a public servant should be he really was a picture of grace i traveled once to houston with president obama when he was in office and there on the tarmac waiting for him was george hw bush in a wheelchair i went up to president bush i said “well sir why are you here” he says “well the president of the united states has come to my city and i just want to say hello”

roiled by another day of protests and looting in the wake of george floyd’s murder 18 people were killed sunday may 31 making it the single most violent day in chicago in six decades according to the university of chicago crime lab the lab’s data doesn’t go back further than 1961 from 7 pm friday may 29 through 5 am monday june 1 25 people were killed in the city with another 85 wounded by gunfire according to data maintained by the chicago suntimes in a city with an international reputation for crime — where 900 murders per year were common in the early 1990s — it was the most violent weekend in chicago’s modern history stretching police resources that were already thin because of protests and looting “we’ve never seen anything like it at all” said max kapustin the senior research director at the crime lab “i don’t even know how to put it into context it’s beyond anything that we’ve ever seen before” the next highest murder total for a single day was on aug 4 1991 when 13 people were killed in chicago according to the crime lab pfleger a time bomb the rev michael pfleger a longtime crusader against gun violence who leads st sabina church in auburn gresham said it was “open season” last weekend in his neighborhood and others on the south and west sides “on saturday and particularly sunday i heard people saying all over ‘hey there’s no police anywhere police ain’t doing nothing’”

lori lightfoot said on may 31 alone chicago’s 911 emergency center received 65000 calls for all types of service — 50000 more than on a usual day pfleger said the systemic problems that have plagued minority communities for decades — like joblessness food insecurity and a lack of housing — already were heightened by the covid19 outbreak which he said “made a bad situation worse” floyd’s killing in minnesota simply brought further to the fore the “hopelessness and anger” felt by those living in blighted communities added pfleger who said the current unrest reminds him of the rioting that broke out when the rev martin luther king jr was assassinated “it’s like a time bomb out here” pfleger said “people are on the edge people are angry people are poor and they don’t even know when it’s going to change” if immediate action isn’t taken to address systemic racism poverty and “black folks being shot down and killed out here like dogs” pfleger said the last weekend in may will merely serve as a “coming attraction of what’s going to happen next” most homicide victims in chicago are young black men and the suspects are too but murders have fallen significantly in recent years along with policeinvolved shootings there were 764 murders and 12 fatal policeinvolved shootings in 2016 compared with 492 murders and three fatal policeinvolved shootings last year “the level of activity experienced over the last week has been unprecedented and the department is actively investigating multiple incidents across the city and working to determine the motives in these cases” chicago

senseless acts of violence” ahern said after “increased violent and criminal activity” on saturday may 30 police canceled days off for all officers and placed them on 12hour shifts in order to direct

glowingly of his former student who he described as a “positive influence” and a leader who for a time served as the vice president of the school’s student government “he was very helpful at deescalating any situations that had potential to kind of escalate into anything further” abdullah said “he was a really good kid” abdullah said he had a “unique” relationship with lewis in addition to joking around and “busting on each other” lewis also helped abdullah acclimate to life in chicago as he was still adjusting after moving from philadelphia “we would sit and talk in my office for hours just about life” he said “so just kind of schooling me on the ins and outs of chicago the do’s and don’ts just kind of what the young people are going through today as far as neighborhood

socially distanced graduation parade to honor the occasion while the day “started off perfect” a trip to a gas station at the corner of 81st and racine — a halfmile south of st sabina — later that day

others struck near her elbow she tried repeatedly to call 911 for help “when i needed help to call the police and stuff nobody responded nobody answered” lofton said “my mom had to come from home and we had to get to the hospital” on the way to little company of mary hospital in evergreen park lofton peered out her mother’s car window and saw the “madness” that was unfolding outside “it was just people jumping out their cars into stores and stealing and looting police was letting them do whatever they wanted” she said “they did not care” lofton added “nobody cared” because the bullet struck

said she plans to increase her efforts now that she’s become a victim “i want to really make some noise” she said late last week lofton was concerned that detectives still hadn’t reached out to her about the shooting which hasn’t been publicly reported by the department police attention diverted expert kapustin of u of c’s crime lab said massive upheavals or protests typically require police departments to divert officers to respond to demonstrations “when cpd has to turn its attention elsewhere and there’s suddenly this vacuum that opens up you also unfortunately see a picture like you saw with last weekend where you see an absurd amount of carnage people getting injured and killed” he said “those forces are still there” kapustin said the current situation “lays bare a really nuanced understanding of the role of the police” “you have to sort of ask yourself how are you going to get to a place where you have a police department that people respect and that has earned the trust of the community but it’s still actually effective at reducing gun violence which is the thing that plagues a lot of these neighborhoods” kapustin said “and we’re so far right now from getting that figured out” ‘great great deal of anxiety’ andrew holmes and pastor donovan price have seen more anguish than most both men respond to crime scenes across the city offering support and comfort to the families of those killed even for them the last weekend in may was different “i’ve been experiencing a great great great great great deal of anxiety” price said “i’ve been hurting i’ve been paining i’ve been crying i’ve been losing sleep for the city because i love the city and so i’ve been hurting for that as well as watching it to a certain level not selfdestruct but definitely take a sip of the poison every now and then” difficulty viewing this map click here in price’s view collaboration between academics clergy and neighborhood leaders has been lacking in the fight to tamp down violence “there’s a difference between swelling and growth and the amount of programs and nonprofits and town halls and all of those things caused a swelling — mainly of the peoples’ heads who were doing them — in thinking that they’ve got this they’ve solved this we’ve got a handle on this” price said lea este artículo en español en la voz chicago un servicio presentado por aarp chicago even aside from his work in aiding bereaved families holmes knows violence all too well his daughter was shot to death in indianapolis in 2015 two years later a young cousin of his — an 11yearold girl — was shot and killed in parkway gardens on the south side in the last week holmes said he’s felt “kind of numb” and can sometimes struggle to find words of comfort for grieving families “because sometimes when they lose their baby there’s not a right word that you can say especially to a mother a woman” holmes said “it took her nine months to give birth and life to that baby and it takes a second for a person to discharge that weapon and take that person’s life and that’s wrong that’s a lot of pain” “i’m not going to sit here and tell you i’m all right” he added “no i’m not all right because i feel that pain i feel that suffering that they’re going through” killed while visiting angelo bronson was standing in englewood’s 6800 block of south laflin on may 31 when someone fired

two people initially taken into custody have been released without charges “john had a big heart he was there for us and his death has taken so much from us” his aunt marie marsham said “when you

college prep in lawndale was found shot by officers at 1051 pm sunday in the 4200 block of west van buren street principal tony sutton called daniels’ death “an incalculable loss for her family and

remembered her for her outgoing personality and ability to make people laugh “keishanay was a person of determination intelligence and joy she had the ability to uplift the mood of anyone near her a gifted young lady who will be truly missed” a resident adviser at lincoln hall dorm wrote police said bolden was killed sunday afternoon when she was shot during an argument in englewood where she grew up thinking about her community for a college assignment last year bolden touched on the gun violence in her neighborhood writing “when one person is hurt everybody is hurt we all might not hurt the same but we can feel that pain when one of ours is hurt” contributing frank main

wisdom human wisdom and they also understand the inevitability of unintended consequences which are the rule they know they wont be in charge forever and so they tread lightly but the bad ones they go crazy and the more power they get the crazier they go power is the drug theyve been searching for its why they went into politics in the first place not to help you or their fellow citizens or to improve our society but to fill the empty space inside themselves these are profoundly damaged people not a single one of them has a functional relationship with their fathers not one unfortunately

clear that cities and states that have cautiously reopened did the right thing they are reaping the benefits of that nowhere has the virus surged back hospitals havent been overwhelmed death rates have not spiked the time for mass quarantines is passed and yet in some places and this is the measure of bad leadership lockdowns are becoming more restrictive not less and much much weirder in illinois for example jb pritzker an aging neerdowell who bought the governors title a year and a half ago for 172 million in inherited money has issued yet another emergency order this time pritzker vows to imprison business owners if they try to reopen this is what happens when neurotic dumb people get power they do neurotic dumb things and then throw you in jail if you complain about it

also unconstitutional many others individual americans are standing up for themselves in quieter ways heres how we know because it controls your smartphone apple can track travel across the country now thats scary but in this case its interesting heres why over this past weekend for the first time since the lockdowns began in midmarch nationwide driving trends were well above the baseline

means and how we can not only uplift this community but everyone else the lgbtq community has accomplished so much over the years yes but there’s still so much ground to cover very good light is celebrating pride month through our very own pride week where we delve into diverse voices that push the boundaries of what being lgbtq in 2018 means it’s june which means millions of people around the world in cities big and small are celebrating pride the lgbtq community is famously known for its inclusivity but there is one sect that doesn’t always feel welcomed republicans see also i’m gay muslim persian and completely unstoppable while at a virginia pride event anthony lecounte along with his then boyfriend now fiancé discovered resistance only when he told people they were both republican he’s come to expect that kind of prejudice but it still takes him aback it wasn’t the first time something like that has happened he and his fiancé once met someone at a gay bar who proceeded to lambast them in a facebook post when finding out they’re republican the worst part it all went down while they were standing right next to each other anthony who goes by rek to friends lives in arlington virginia a city just outside of washington dc he’s black openly gay and proudly conservative and if that sounds like a contradiction he wants to dispel those stereotypes gay people have diverse views like any other minority group he tells very good light coming from a military family he moved around a lot—florida to tennessee tennessee to kentucky kentucky to germany and then back to the states he’s been out longer than he’s been republican anthony came out his senior year of high school but didn’t cement his political ideology until he began questioning and rethinking his assumptions that was around the same time he graduated from yale anthony speaks slowly with the drawl and the charm that comes with growing up in the south i ask what misconceptions he faces and he returned with a long list people tend to think gay republicans are all “super white” wealthy privileged and they don’t care about other members of the lgbtq community the most repeated stereotype that they are inherently selfhating the idea that being simultaneously gay and republican somehow means you’re uncomfortable with your sexual identity is something that every one of the handful of gay men i talked to have dealt with it’s flatout untrue they emphasized they are just as proud of their gay identity as anyone else it’s that reason anthony is sometimes hesitant to tell gay people he’s republican in the same way he’s sometimes resistant to telling republicans he’s gay but he says the reaction he gets from conservatives pales in comparison to the vitriol he’s received from gay liberals “it stems from this notion that we are traitors to the gay community” he tells me “but at the end of the day that kind of thinking is reductive and kind of insensitive” “it stems from this notion that we are traitors to the gay community” gay conservatives often get a bad wrap at least partially because one of the group’s most vocal members is milo yiannopoulos an altright political commentator and provocateur who recently said “i can’t wait for the vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down on sight” add that to his already long list of controversies including gamergate and comments that suggested he supports pedophilia but milo is nowhere near representative of the group as a whole andrew dresser 28 confirms that other gay people aren’t always open to civil political discussions he’s been called a toxic selfhating person online and told that “trump supporters shouldn’t reproduce” meaning his parents shouldn’t have had him we live in a hyperpartisan world and any community will have disagreements but andrew says “the lgbtq community as a whole either outright disdains or at best mildly disrespects people who are republican” he’s often accused of voting against his own civil rights he doesn’t pretend that the republican party’s been supportive of lgbtq rights throughout history but believe it or not he says it’s actively improving according to the pew research center 61 of republicans in the 1829 age group support gay marriage compared to 69 support by all americans in that group part of that change he says comes from his own advocacy and the work of people like him andrew also lives the dc metropolitan area and has been active in lobbying congress on behalf of the lgbtq community as a board member of the dc chapter of the log cabin republicans a special interest group composed of gay conservatives that work within the republican party he says they’ve made a lot of headway on the local and federal level they’ve worked with republican members of congress to help repeal don’t ask don’t tell sponsor the employment nondiscrimination act enda a legislative proposal that would ban discrimination in hiring and employment based on gender identity or sexual orientation and lobby for other issues like marriage equality and gay adoption though andrew recognizes there’s still a lot they’re trying to do in terms of transgender rights “amicable debates are hard to come by in today’s political climate but are more crucial than ever” this year was his fourth operating the log cabin booth at dc pride and it was his most positive one yet aside from a couple of people who were looking to cause strife people engaged in meaningful respectful conversations those kinds of amicable debates are hard to come by in today’s political climate but are more crucial than ever “i think that it’s important as with any community that you don’t put your eggs all in one basket” he says “in order to be successful on a national level you have to engage with both parties” dating presents other challenges before anthony met his husband he was careful about who he shared his political identification with andrew’s often wondered if the men who’ve ghosted him have done so because of his political party aside from the dual chambers on capitol hill at the end of the day dc is a city known for being able to put aside political disagreements but politics is also a common conversation topic and it can lead to some awkward moments at the end of our conversation i asked anthony if there was something he wished people understood just like your gender identity or sexual orientation he says your political beliefs do not determine your worth as a human being “being gay only defines you in the way you let it define you” political disagreements are natural and healthy and ultimately inevitable but excluding any lgbtq person based on them is not within the spirit of the community debate but do so with respect for others as human beings demonizing and stereotyping the other side and creating an intolerant landscape to political disagreements serves no one’s interests

aioeaj,2019-01-22 18:17:42,Republican,"Why did the far-left media attack the MAGA kids so viciously? Because they know teenagers are increasingly rebelling against SJW culture. And as usual, Progressives try to demonize any group they see as an ideological threat.",http://theculturechronicles.com/index.php/2019/01/22/why-did-the-far-left-media-attack-the-maga-kids-so-viciously-because-they-know-teenagers-are-increasingly-rebelling-against-sjw-culture/,SuperCharged2000,568,142,with the viral story of the maga kids still being unpacked by the mainstream media despite the irrefutable proof that the covington high school kids did nothing wrong we need to look at one reason the media was so quick to viciously attack these underage boys as soon as the video got out the response by the progressive media and farleft pundits was nothing less than violent they demanded the kids be doxxed there were countless calls for violence from prominent figures on the progressive left including entertainment figures the boys were called nazis even the look on the one boy’s face was described as evil when all he was doing was simply smiling to avoid a confrontation with a grown man invading his personal space so why was the response so violent and swift against these kids one reason is because progressives know they are losing the upandcoming younger generation i’m talking about people under 20 years old these kids are growing up as a counterculture to what they see in the media the reason is because that’s simply what kids do kids growing up end up doing mostly the opposite of what the previous generation of kids did growing up that’s how its been for all of modern culture and that’s exactly how it’s happening now many younger kids under 20 see sjw culture as weak and not something they want to be a part of and when you think about it it makes perfect sense teenagers always want to be rebellious and its been that way throughout time and throughout cultures so why would teenagers be attracted to an ideology that promotes victimhood why would they be attracted to a group who gets triggered by something as simple as clapping or need “cry rooms” and safe spaces to deal with normal life it’s no wonder rebellious teenagers are turning against sjw culture and the progressive movement realizes this and that’s one of the reasons they came down so hard on those innocent kids progressives know that the teenagers coming up are not falling for sjw or ultrapc identity politics and it scares them so what do progressives do to combat this they do what they try to do to anyone that opposes them these days they demonize them it’s no different than how progressives try to demonize and smear black trump supporters and conservatives and it’s what we saw done to the maga kids there is no other reason to elicit such a visceral and hateful reaction from the progressive left other than the fact that they see in those kids a future where modern sjw culture is eventually cast aside like last years fashions the progressive left has built their whole identity on sjw ideals and for them to feel it may go “out of style” fills them with fear so they lashed out the same way they do when anyone calls their illogical beliefs into question for evidence that teenagers are rejecting sjw culture one doesn’t have to look very far for example the largest creator on youtube is pewdiepie he often pokes fun at sjw culture to the point where he has been falsely accused of racism by vox media and the wall street journal vox runs countless stories attacking pewdiepie and it’s because they know his often mocking message against sjw culture is resonating with young people the fact is teenagers watch more youtube than regular television so the fact that someone like pewdiepie who makes fun of sjw culture is the most subscribed youtuber in history speaks volumes as to what teenagers are thinking another example is in the gaming community recently a major video game franchise called battlefield v was released to huge criticism a large part of that is due to the fact that the publisher of the game forced sjw ideology into what was suppose to be a historically accurate world war 1 game although people of all ages enjoy gaming these days the hardcore gamers definitely skew younger so the rejection of a popular franchise like battlefield due to forced identity politics being injected into the game points to what the younger generation is thinking so while the maga kids story will start to die down in the next few days don’t be surprised to see the left attacking other young people who oppose their progressive ideology progressives know their time pushing identity politics for political gain is coming to an end note if you enjoyed this article please make sure to share it also we are now advertisingfree to support our site and content visit our shop full of exclusive proamerican and meme inspired gear click here to visit our store

fg2qxi,2020-03-10 01:00:19,Republican,Karl Marx was a Pretty Bad Person,https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/karl-marx-was-pretty-bad-person,im-yeeting,561,49,when karl marx died in march 1883 only about a dozen people attended his funeral at a cemetery in london england including family members yet for more than a century after his death – and even until today – there have been few thinkers whose ideas have been as influential on various aspects of modern world history indeed as some have said no other faith or beliefsystem has had such a worldwide impact as marxism since the birth of christianity and the rise of islam marx’s critique of capitalism and capitalist society has shaped much of the social thinking in western countries that led to the welfare state and extensive government intervention into economic affairs and it served as the ideological banner that inspired the socialist and communist revolutions of the twentieth century – beginning in russia in 1917 and still retaining political power today in such countries as cuba north korea vietnam and china in the name of the marxian vision of a “new society” and a “new man” socialist and communist revolutions led to the mass murders enslavement torture and starvation of tens of millions of people around the world historians have estimated that in the attempt to make that “new” and “better” socialist world communist regimes have killed as many as maybe 200 million people in the twentieth century marx’s private life karl marx was born on may 5 1818 in the rhineland town of trier his parents were jewish with a long line of respected rabbis on both sides of the family but to follow a legal career in the kingdom of prussia at the time karl marx’s father converted to protestantism karl’s own religious training was limited at an early age he rejected all belief in a supreme being after studying for a time in bonn he transferred to the university of berlin to work on a doctoral degree in philosophy but he was generally a lazy and goodfornothing student the money that his father sent to him for tuition at the university was spent on food and drink with many of his nights spent at coffee houses and taverns getting drunk and arguing about hegelian philosophy with other students he finally acquired his doctoral degree by submitting his dissertation to the university of jena in eastern germany marx’s only real jobs during his lifetime were as occasional reporters for or editors of newspapers and journals most of which usually closed in a short period of time either because of small readership and limited financial support or political censorship by the governments under which he was living his political activities as a writer and activist resulted in his having to move several times including to paris and brussels finally ending up in london in 1849 where he lived for the rest of his life with occasional trips back to the european continent though marx was “middle class” and even “victorian” in many of his everyday cultural attitudes this did not stop him from breaking his marriage vows and committing adultery he had sex enough times with the family maid that she bore him an illegitimate son – and this under the same roof with his wife and his legitimate children of which he had seven with only three living to full adulthood but he would not allow his illegitimate child to visit their mother in his london house whenever he was at home and the boy could only enter the house through the kitchen door in the back of the house in addition he had his friend longtime financial benefactor and intellectual collaborator fredrick engels claim parentage of the child so to avoid any social embarrassment falling upon himself due to his infidelity as historian paul johnson explained in his book intellectuals 1988 in all his researches into the iniquities of british capitalism he came across many instances of lowpaid workers but he never succeeded in unearthing one who was paid literally no wages at all yet such a worker did exist in his own household this was helen demuth the lifelong family maid she got her keep but was paid nothing she was a ferociously hard worker not only cleaning and scrubbing but managing the family budget marx never paid her a penny in 184950 helen became marx’s mistress and conceived a child marx refused to acknowledge his responsibility then or ever and flatly denied the rumors that he was the father… the son was put out to be fostered by a workingclass family called lewis but allowed to visit the marx household to see his mother he was however forbidden to use the front door and obliged to see his mother only in the kitchen marx was terrified that the boy’s paternity would be discovered and that this would do him fatal damage as a revolutionary leader and seer marx persuaded engels to acknowledge the boy privately as a cover story for family consumption but engels was not willing to take the secret to the grave engels died of cancer of the throat on 5 august 1895 unable to speak but unwilling that eleanor one of marx’s daughters should continue to think her father unsullied he wrote on a slate ‘freddy the boy’s name is marx’s son marx’s mean and mendacious manner in temperament marx could be cruel and authoritarian he treated people with whom he disagreed in a crude and mean way often ridiculing them in public gatherings marx had no hesitation about being a hypocrite when he wanted something from someone he would flatter them in letters or conversation but then attack them in nasty language behind their backs to others he often used racial slurs and insulting words to describe the mannerisms or appearance of his opponents in the socialist movement for instance in an 1862 letter to frederick engels marx described leading nineteenthcentury german socialist ferdinand lassalle in the following way the jewish nigger lassalle fortunately departs at the end of this week it is now absolutely clear to me that as both the shape of his head and his hair texture shows – he descends from the negros who joined moses’ flight from egypt unless his mother or grandmother on the paternal side hybridized with a nigger now this combination of germanness and jewishness with a primarily negro substance creates a strange product the pushiness of the fellow is also niggerlike in marx’s mind the jew in bourgeois society encapsulated the essence of everything he considered despicable in the capitalist system and only with the end of the capitalist system would there be an end to most of those unattractive qualities here is marx’s conception of the jewish mind in nineteenth century europe from his essay on the jewish question 1844 what is the secular basis of judaism practical need selfinterest what is the worldly cult of the jew haggling what is his worldly god money money is the jealous god of israel before whom no other god may exist money degrades all the gods of mankind and converts them into commodities what is contained abstractly in the jewish religion – contempt for theory for art for history for man as an end in himself the social emancipation of the jew is the emancipation of society from jewishness marx’s caricaturing description of the asserted “jewish mindset” rings amazingly similar to those that were later written by the nazi “racescientists” of the 1930s who also condemned jews for the same selfinterested pursuit of money and the resulting degenerative influence that they believed jews had upon the german people marx was also what some might label as a plagiarist from 1852 to 1862 marx worked as a european correspondent for the new york daily tribune marx found it too burdensome to grind out the expected two articles per week for which he was relatively well paid instead he spent his time participating in revolutionary intrigues and researching reading and writing for what became his famous work das kapital during marx’s decade of employment with the newspaper friedrich engels wrote about onethird of his articles marx’s name still appeared on the bylines a filthy home and a personality to match many found marx’s personal appearance and manner offputting or even revolting in 1850 a spy for the prussian police visited marx’s home in london under the pretense of a german revolutionary the report the spy wrote was shared with the british ambassador in berlin the report said in part marx leads the existence of a bohemian intellectual washing grooming and changing his linen are things he does rarely and he is often drunk though he is frequently idle for days on end he will work day and night with tireless endurance when he has much work to do he has no fixed time for going to sleep or waking up he often stays up all night and then lies down fully clothed on the sofa at midday and sleeps till evening untroubled by the whole world coming or going through his room there is not one clean and solid piece of furniture everything is broken tattered and torn with half an inch of dust over everything and the greatest disorder everywhere when you enter marx’s room smoke and tobacco fumes make your eyes water everything is dirty and covered with dust so that to sit down becomes a hazardous business here is a chair with three legs on another chair the children are playing cooking this chair happens to have four legs this is the one that is offered to the visitor but the children’s cooking has not been wiped away and if you sit down you risk a pair of trousers another report on meeting marx was given by gustav techow a prussian military officer who had joined the berlin insurrectionists during the failed revolution of 1848 techow had to escape to switzerland after being sentenced and imprisoned for treason the revolutionary group with whom techow associated in switzerland sent him to london and he spent time with marx in a letter to his revolutionary associates techow described his impression of marx the man and his mind the picture was of a powerlusting personality who had contempt for both friends and foes he gave me the impression of both outstanding intellectual superiority and a most impressive personality if he had had as much heart as brain as much love as hate i would have gone through fire with him despite the fact that he not only did not hide his contempt for me but as the end was quite explicit about it i regret because of our cause that this man does not have together with his outstanding intelligence a noble heart to place at our disposal i am convinced that everything good in him has been devoured by the most dangerous personal ambitions he laughs at the fools who repeat after him his proletarian catechism just as he laughs at other communists and also at the bourgeoisie despite all of his assurances to the contrary perhaps precisely because of them i left with the impression that personal domination is the endall of his every activity and marx considers that all of his old associates are despite their considerable talents well beneath and behind him and should they ever dare to forget that he will put them back in their places with the impudence worth of a napoleon playbook for revolution and mass murder marx’s desire to destroy the institutions of society and his bloodthirst towards enemies in the coming communist revolution was captured in his plan of action written with engels for the central committee of the communist league in march 1850 it reads like the literal playbook for what vladimir lenin did in undertaking the bolshevik revolution in russia he stated that the goal of the organization was “the overthrow of the privileged classes” initially in cooperation with the petty and liberal “bourgeois” political parties marx warned that these democratic parties only want to establish a liberal agenda of reduced government spending more secure private property rights and some welfare programs for the poor instead marx said its our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent until all the more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling positions until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far – not only in one country but in all the leading countries of the world our concern cannot simply be to modify private property but to abolish it not to hush up class antagonisms but to abolish classes not to improve the existing society but to found a new one in the process of overthrowing the liberal democratic order that assumes power following the end of the monarchical rulers marx said that the revolutionary proletariat needed to form armed “councils” outside of the democratic government’s authority and control this is the very method lenin insisted upon in russia in the form of “soviets” after the abdication of the russian czar in march 1917 and in opposition to the newly established provisional democratic government that replaced the russian monarchy marx insisted that the feudal lands were not to be turned into peasantowned private farms no instead they were to be taken over by the state and transformed into collective farms upon which all among rural population will be made to live and work and all industries had to be nationalized under an increasingly centralized and allpowerful proletarian government to assure the end of capitalism and “bourgeois” democracy in addition marx said the communist leaders must work to ensure that the immediate revolutionary excitement is not suddenly suppressed after the victory on the contrary it must be sustained as long as possible far from opposing the socalled excesses – instances of popular vengeance against hated individuals or against public buildings with which hateful memories are associated – the workers’ party must not only tolerate these actions but must even give them direction in other words marx was insisting upon fostering a frenzy of “vengeance against hated individuals” that clearly meant terror and mass murder and this too was the signpost that lenin followed in assuring the triumph of his revolution in russia the foundation for real tragedy how did marx become an advocate of mass murder and dictatorship in place of liberal democracy and social peace what intellectual influences worked on him that lead to his becoming the visionary advocate of what he came to call “scientific socialism” and the belief that the “laws of history” dictated the inevitable doom of capitalism and the inescapable triumph of communism and how did his conception of mankind’s destiny create the foundation for the human tragedy of “socialisminpractice” in the twentieth century

Them",https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/16/condoleezza_rice_china_wants_to_shift_the_narrative_on_covid-19_dont_let_them.html,Foubar,566,63,hoover institution fellow condoleezza rice speaks with hoovers tom gilligan about the reckoning the chinese communist party is likely to face over its handling of the covid19 outbreak and both the public and private conversations us officials should have with them rice primarily accuses china of a coverup of the early outbreak of the virus which cost the world time that could have been used to prepare it is very hard to get answers from china she said the chinese did what authoritarians do she said they silenced those who were trying to sound the alarm they wanted time to create the narrative that would be blessed by the communist party of china which means it probably had to go to beijing before you could say anything it is just the nature of the system it is a real problem can you imagine those people being silenced in the united states or germany or brazil she asked no it would have been known that there was a problem the chinese and trying to create a counternarrative to shift the narrative from their initial responsibility for not fessing up to what was happening to we got on top of it and this is how we helped the world thats how theyre going to shift the narrative dont let it happen she concluded if you keep the focus on how this started and chinas role in that they will be embarrassed by that if you let them shift the narrative to all theyve done sending out ppe youre probably not going to make progress tom gilligan you were the national security advisor during the sars outbreak what are the important similarities and differences between then and now condoleezza rice one of the unfortunate similarities is it is hard to get information out of china with the sars outbreak we knew something had happened it was very hard to get answers from china about what had happened and that is unfortunately a recurring pattern this time around it is probably the most troubling aspect of this crisis it is kind of in the nature of the chinese system an authoritarian system where control of information is power control of the narrative is power so we shouldnt be surprised that when this outbreak happened in wuhan they silenced the young physicians and medical students who were trying to sound the alarm can you imagine those people being silenced in the united states or germany or brazil no somebody in the press would have picked up the story it would have been known that there was a problem but the chinese did what authoritarians do they silenced those who were trying to sound the alarm and they wanted time to create the narrative that would be blessed by the communist party of china which means it probably had to go to beijing before you could say anything it is just the nature of the system it is a real problem and there is going to be a reckoning for china on this with its own population which was angered by the lack of information and certainly the international community should raise this with the chinese very strongly why we always get this response questions what sanctions and how should china be held to account for this what is the proper measured response to china and the ccp leadership who clearly withheld information about the wuhan virus in light of the hundreds of thousands of deaths and trillions of cost to the world condoleezza rice there is a public part of this and a private part this is the public part over the next months is to let it be known that china responded in the way that it did or didnt respond i should say the chinese and trying to create a counternarrative well when we found out about it we got on top of it look at how quickly trough social distancing and quarantine how quickly we recovered and by the way weve been helping the rest of the world by sending ppe and help and aid to all of the world theyre going to try to shift the narrative from their initial responsibility for not fessing up to what was happening to we got on top of it and this is how we helped the world thats how theyre going to shift the narrative dont let it happen we have to have a really honest assessment about where this started how it started when it started when the communist party knew and why they didnt get on it thats the public part the private part is you have to go to the chinese and say you cant keep doing this you have to be a more responsible partner a more responsible power given your weight now in the international system youre not just some little developing country that when something happens it doesnt have an impact your people travel your people work in other countries there are apparently a lot of chinese workers in italy at the time was that the transmission belt we dont know for sure but if were going to get a handle on how this thing spread china is such a big player and its people travel work elsewhere is a big part of the story question is jawboning enough to get them to have a more correct attitude towards the world health organization toward sharing scientific data that has an impact on the rest of the world or do you have to couple it with sanctions or tariffs or limiting trade how would you as former secretary of state think about something like that i would certainly try the persuasion route first because i think if you keep the focus on how this started and chinas role in that they will be embarrassed by that if you let them shift the narrative to all theyve done sending out ppe youre probably not going to make progress i would go to the un security council and i would call a meeting theyll try to veto anything that comes out of it but id call a meeting and say the us is going to share the information maybe this is where we can bring the europeans and others along were going to share the information on how this started i would try that campaign first because i dont really think the us economy and everyone is going to be trying to recover i dont think we want to shock the system more with more sanctions and more trade wars while the system is trying to recover so id certainly try that method first lets call it calling names and send a message that what they did is unacceptable

Tens of millions will never blindly follow their narratives again.",http://theculturechronicles.com/index.php/2019/02/19/trumps-most-lasting-achievement-may-be-exposing-the-fake-mainstream-media/,freq-ee,563,115,considering the unprecedented and unfair opposition that president trump has had to deal with his policy accomplishments over the past two years are very impressive even under normal political circumstances the achievements of this administration would be considered near historic in just the first two years but when you factor in the fact that trump has had to deal with what now is an obviously corrupt and partisan fbi investigation his administration’s accomplishments become even more impressive but despite trump delivering on conservative supreme court justices peace in the korean peninsula and forcing the issue of border security to the forefront after decades of neglect by both parties there is one achievement that isn’t talked about as much and it’s this very achievement that may very well have the most lasting impact on this country and possibly the world trump has ushered in a period of skepticism towards the elitecontrolled media and deep state establishments that has never been seen before an entire generation of americans across a wide spectrum of demographics now all question the narratives controlled by the elitist media this is no small task for decades the media enjoyed an unassailable position in our democracy any questioning of the press was deemed an attack on free speech but now tens of millions of americans view the elitist mainstream media with extreme skepticism and distrust now some on the left and in the media would call this skepticism a bad thing that americans not trusting the press is a threat to democracy but nothing could be further from the truth the elite media is not some underdog as they try to portray themselves when they get called out for their propaganda instead the media is a tightly controlled and small group of billion dollar conglomerates which control virtually everything you see and hear there is nothing “underdog” about them at all they have the power to control the national dialogue however they see fit it makes perfect sense that everyday americans should question the messaging from these few companies that control so much of what we all see and hear and for far too long the media has been terribly biased and in some cases controlled by corporate influence of course there has always been talk of a media bias in the media but generally the american public felt that what they read in the paper or saw on the evening news was mostly factual but then something happened trump became president and tens of millions of his supporters saw exactly how biased and unfair the mainstream media can be a big part of this was because trump himself was not afraid to call out the press for what they were doing no other president has had the audacity to rail against an unfair press the way trump has and all of his attacks on the “fake news” caused the media to go into overdrive trying to smear trump and his supporters even more but all they did was expose themselves and their overt bias for all the world to see the mainstream media will never recover their credibility after what has happened over the past two years the notion of fake news is now common knowledge – it’s part of the culture and now even longtime respected journalists are coming forward and saying that the mainstream media has failed at their core duty of fairness and objectivity just today in an interview with the mike drop podcast longtime journalist lara logan spoke out against the mainstream media at one point even comparing what they currently do to propaganda the 47 year old logan an award winning journalist and in the business since she was 17 stated that her comments could very well be career suicide a reference to the fact that most media companies would not hire anyone with opposing views but all of this skepticism of the mainstream media wouldn’t have been possible without trump conservatives have always complained about liberal bias in he media but trump’s presidency blew the lid off of it trump led the charge against “fake news” and his message resonated with his tens of millions of supporters those people will never blindly trust the media or its narratives again instead they will always be skeptical and will always question what they see and hear from media sources – both ones they agree with and ones they oppose and that’s what makes this one of trump’s most transformative accomplishments because skepticism like that will last for a generation and possibly beyond note if you enjoyed this article please make sure to share it also we are now advertisingfree to support our site and content visit our shop full of exclusive proamerican and meme inspired gear click here to visit our store
gp4qm2,2020-05-23 16:15:28,Republican,"Where Is Cuomo’s Apology for Killing 10,000 People? No ifs, no ands, no buts — just a tearful mea culpa from the Nursing Home Killer.",https://spectator.org/where-is-cuomos-apology-for-killing-10000-people-covid-19-nursing-homes/,Foubar,556,114,look there is a difference between “murder” and “killing” murder is purposeful and indefensible regardless of degree by contrast humans value professionals who kill ants spiders roaches and termites killing is more nuanced soldiers kill the enemy and that is the whole idea police kill bad guys and that usually is very good store owners kill people who hold them up and that usually is fabulous other killings are not acceptable thus accidental killings still are tortious if not always criminal automobile and other roadway killings accidents at home and then there is cuomo i do not quite fathom the mind of the quintessential new york democrat liberal i grew up in brooklyn surrounded by democrats who really all were deeply conservative but had no other party to vote for in a oneparty town that the republicans abandoned so they elected solid “democrats for reagan” types then i went to college at columbia in manhattan where i suddenly was submerged into a liberal muck all the nonstem professors were radical left and i was a social sciences major the political science classes all had marx and engels on every reading list by the time i graduated i had been assigned to read marx so often that i practically could quote his every antisemitic statement by heart the leftists were everywhere the professors in the religion department with one exception did not believe in gd the english language and other language and literature classes all had a profoundly leftward bent when the columbia daily spectator the studentrun newspaper took an oncampus poll before the 1972 presidential elections they found that something like 80 or 90 percent were voting for george mcgovern against nixon i don’t even think nixon came in second in the poll he got beaten by the prosoviet communist party candidate gus hall the guy supported by obama’s future cia director john brennan nixon may even have come in third or fourth behind some other communist when the actual national election results came in with nixon winning the biggest landslide ever people at columbia were convinced it was because of ballotstuffing like the democrat election judge in philadelphia so i lived and learned for years among new york’s most elite leftist thinkers imagine — four years at an ivy league college majoring in political science and the only time i ever heard of ayn rand was when i needed to go to a doctor on the campus health plan and the guy made small talk with me sensed my conservative frustration told me about her and sent me off with a prescription for a nose spray and another to read we the living so as we would say in the brooklyn ’hood where i grew up i know “from” liberals oh boy — gevalt — do i ever know “from” liberals but i still cannot fathom the mental disconnect from reality that induced cuomo — not fredo who despises the cnn employer who pays him millions to attack the president daily but the more dignified one who told our nation that america never was all that great anyway — to order new york nursing homes which were medically and structurally unprepared for the challenge to admit coronavirus sufferers into their facilities under the governor’s orders they were coerced to comply and somewhere along the lines of 10000 seniors died as a result cuomo’s own government admits to nearly 6000 of the killings attributable to his order the data are so shocking and indefensible that he understandably now plays threecard monte and does not count among his nursinghome killings any senior who contracted covid19 in a skilled nursing facility and thereafter was removed to die in a hospital no question that the honest tally is closer to 10000 cuomo killings quaere whether the federal sentencing guidelines distinguish much between killing 5000 or 10000 people certainly any fairminded critic will acknowledge that cuomo did not set out to kill 10000 seniors purposefully and yet and yet richard speck murdered eight nurses the two animals who together were discovered to comprise “the hillside strangler” murdered as many as 12 women richard david falco the “son of sam” nut job murdered six ted bundy murdered at least 30 cuomo is not in that category because he lacked mens rea the latin term we attorneys and law professors use to connote the evil intent in a killer’s state of mind to commit murder cuomo only killed so what indeed was he thinking when he ordered seniors’ facilities to take in the covid19 infected most probably — and this suggestion is posited to defend him — he simply was not thinking or was thinking about an upcoming election i have a dearly beloved relative — may he live to 120 — who for several years has been cared for and residing in a wonderful kosherfood jewishseniors’ facility in the northeast thank gd almity that facility is not in new york new jersey or in one of the other madhouse states where liberal democrat governors ordered unprepared nursing homes to admit coronavirus into their facilities cuomo gets megaplaudits on cnn abc nbc cbs pbs msnbc in the new york times the washington post and wherever else truth is distorted into lies and lies are falsified into truth in such media he is the antitrump the genius of the coronavirus season measured methodical liberal democrat why he ought to run for president of the united states — and there’s still time for this savior to do it assuming he can get around stacey abrams who has eclipsed him and most everyone else but figures don’t lie even though liars can figure cuomo’s new york state somehow managed to become home to half of all american coronavirus cases and coronavirus deaths to be sure new york poses its own unique challenges it is an international hub housing is more crowded we all have seen and many of us have walked the famously crowded manhattan streets the new york city subway system is the antithesis of social distancing where five people struggle for dear life each to claim five inches of space on the ubiquitous straphanger’s pole beyond that the city has an idiot for a mayor and he in turn appointed as new york city health commissioner a medical miracle who urged the public to ignore social distancing and to go out mingling during the chinese new year even as she later would refuse to provide protective masks for new york police saying she did “not give two rat’s ases” about them so new york does have its challenges at least some selfinflicted even so cuomo owes the survivors of his 10000 victims the most deep heartfelt apology imaginable and not one of those famous political “if apologies” — “if i offended you by calling your mother a prostitute” … “if i offended you by saying that your child is genetically defective” … “if i offended you by mocking your racial identity religious belief ethnic heritage … ” rather cuomo owes an incredibly candid tearful apology for killing some 10000 grandparents parents brothers sisters — people — who were among society’s least able to defend themselves from his killing onslaught in new york city the tabloids are famous for appending nicknames to killers i just googled “the nursing home killer” and the name remains available america awaits the nonif apology from new york’s nursing home killer

progressives – who consider the former first lady and failed presidential candidate the “devil in a designer pantsuit” – have a fit of apoplexy or crucify yours truly for being an apostate let me explain what i am convinced hillary clinton was right about and why still i am obliged to remind readers that in opinion columns for al jazeera and elsewhere my antipathy for clinton’s regressive credentials at home and signature support for america’s inhumane and calamitous “shock and awe” adventures abroad is plain but i am also obliged to give credit when and where credit is due you may recall during a dinner in 2016 to raise money for her bid to become president clinton made some uncharitable remarks about many not all of president donald trump’s supporters and by implication her opponent clinton shared with her wellheeled admirers a blunt stinging precis on the essential character of not only trump but the people who attended his “rallies” that pulsated with incendiary anger and indecency “you know to just be grossly generalistic you could put half of trump’s supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables right” clinton said “the racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamophobic – you name it and unfortunately there are people like that and he has lifted them up” that is not all clinton said “trump tweets and retweets their offensive hateful meanspirited rhetoric now some of those folks – they are irredeemable but thankfully they are not america” clinton was right on every count trump his followers and enablers inside and outside congress are indeed an “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables” and since his election in 2016 they have confirmed time and again every wretched quality she ascribed to them in her scathing address it would be an exercise in redundancy to describe or tally the familiar litany of appalling acts committed by trump and his vulgar allies the evidence of their irredeemably deplorable behaviour is today glaring and overwhelming yet at the time clinton’s caustic comments were condemned as a politically unwise and irresponsible ad hominem attack on americans she claimed to want to lead as commanderinchief i believed then as i do now that clinton’s surprising candour – however fleeting or novel – was refreshing and laudable as an adjunct to this i found clinton’s critics hypocritical in their condescending reproach of her remarks and too genteel to tell the blatant truth about the sinister makeamericagreatagain baseballcapwearing crowd rather the allknowingallthetime pundits scolded clinton for being a stiff calculating candidate who lacked authenticity and spontaneity clinton’s speech may have had a calculating tint but it was arguably the most authentic moment of her campaign it is memorable precisely because it was a remarkable and unexpected departure of form reportedly she had previously roadtested the “deplorables” line in an interview with an israeli news station in that moment before that audience clinton opted to say out loud what many other politicians were hesitant to say out loud to avoid alienating trump’s “base” in a futile and ludicrous bid to win their favour clearly clinton did not share their equivocations or reservations bully for her joe biden acknowledged recently that 1015 percent of americans “are just not very good people” i think he was being conservative turns out clinton was as prescient as she was right these days it is fashionable for previously circumspect writers to finally and enthusiastically invoke clinton’s once verboten language in columns that explore what attracts and binds trumpsters to trump more learned scribes turn to the incisive tomes of renowned psychoanalysts like sigmund freud and carl jung to try to analyse the pathology that defines trump and the evangelical loyalty he inspires “they feel caricaturized and vilified and in many ways they are and have been for decades now” one repentant ex“i hate trump voters” columnist explained “these people are frightened frustrated and suffering” here is i suppose my unembroidered insensitive reply just as sometimes a cigar is just a cigar a deplorable trumpster can sometimes just be deplorable by any sentient measure it is deplorable to not only traffic in a cesspool of conspiracy theories about the origins a still raging pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 120000 americans but to declare the virus a “hoax” orchestrated by scientists intent on depriving deplorables of a haircut by any sentient measure it is deplorable to carry big loaded automatic weapons into statehouses and claim often incoherently that an overt act of intimidation is somehow a reflection of the “freedoms” enshrined in the us constitution by any sentient measure it is deplorable to tar often incoherently millions of americans demanding an end to police brutality and ingrained systemic racism as “terrorists” or “wild animals” who need to be “put down” by any sentient measure it is deplorable to insist that yet another murder of yet another black man by police warrants the us president and his complicit accomplices to threaten to deploy the military to shoot americans protesting against george floyd’s murder i could go on and on and on but i expect you get the deplorable point there are predictably progressives who refuse to call a deplorable spade a deplorable spade instead they cling to the absurd “what’s with those us protesters the ones out to end the lockdown so they can return to work and get fatally infected crazy that’s not very empathetic the best explanation i’ve heard is they’re people who’ve been lied to by experts for 40 years about what’s good for them like free trade or privatization as in senior care and it was all dishonest verbal garbage that destroyed jobs and communities” another columnist recently wrote the paragraph’s logic such as it is escapes me to suggest that repudiating epidemiologists’ advice to wear a mask and social distance somehow reflects a mass epiphany by the deplorables that “experts” have habitually lied “about what’s good for them” is a laughable affront to reality i cannot recall a deplorable ever saying “i refuse to wear a mask to protect me and others from a hoax virus because all those experts lied to me about free trade and privatization” can you i am through attempting to understand or tolerate any sympathy from any quarter for a deplorable clan who plan to vote for a deplorable clan leader this coming november if that makes trump’s rabid deplorables call me deplorable – well so be it the views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect al jazeera’s editorial stance

hv0mkj,2020-07-21 07:11:29,Republican,Portland Goes To Hell: The Death Of An American City,https://issuesinsights.com/2020/07/21/portland-goes-to-hell-the-death-of-an-american-city/,Foubar,555,83,portland oregon was once known as the quintessentially nice northwestern city its nickname “the rose city” was given to it by a baptist group that held a convention there over a century ago sadly today riotriven portland smells like anything but roses the city has been the locus of nonstop violent protests for 51 days and counting and really calling them protests is incorrect they are acts of outright rebellion with many participants openly calling for the dismantling of the united states the daily caller described the mayhem and posted videos of it which included the attempted torching of the police association building portland has seen over 50 days of protests and rioting and saturday proved to be no different daily caller reporters were at the scene where rioters squared off with officers after tearing down fencing and using it to barricade the federal courthouse … outside of the mark o hatfield us courthouse hundreds gathered and immediately began removing fencing surrounding the park and courthouse that had been erected by officers some rioters barricaded the building and began to taunt officers by banging on the walls and yelling for them to come outside while all this was going on more “largely peaceful” protesters broke into the police union’s building and tried to burn it down that’s called arson and it’s a felony who’s behind all this antifa and black lives matter of course but they aren’t the only ones there are lots of other leftists of various affiliations agitating the crowds one in particular who’s come to our attention is a socalled organizer of the violent protests she describes herself in a viral twitter video “my name is lilith sinclair i’m an afroindigenous nonbinary local organizer here in portland organizing for the abolition of not just the militarized police state but also the united states as we know it” just so you know “abolition” in this context means “violent overthrow” alrighty then so much for these being “peaceful demonstrations” about “social justice” as the media keep telling us ad nauseam by the way sinclair and her cohorts call portland “stolen land” and thus feel anything they do is justified for extremists ends however mistaken or evil always justify the means the fevered rhetoric by the left predictably has engendered violence which has been met with an equally predictable response by the federal government to protect its property buildings and most of all employees farleft activists across the nation decried “storm troopers” and lied about “unidentified” federal troops that whisked away demonstrators in unmarked vans to unknown fates the truth photos clearly show “police” “homeland security” and other identifying marks on their clothing let us add as a note to portland’s antifa blm and their wokester supporters yes when you break the law you get arrested not surprisingly after the federal government did its job the american civil liberties union stepped in on the side of the rioters and sued the government to keep it from further enforcing the law this has nothing to do with first amendment free speech rights as the aclu claims it’s about violent lawbreaking assaults on citizens and police and wanton destruction of property all against the law aclu supports it this is part of a pattern of how the left works destroy the rule of law the backbone of our free republic intimidate ordinary citizens into silence then support and elevate rule by power of unelected street thugs in antifa and blm the meek may inherit the earth but they won’t get the big cities none of what we’re seeing should be viewed as a surprise or some sort of accident far from it the city’s mayor ted wheeler and portland’s farleft city council have not only permitted the violence but enabled and encouraged it – just as mayors in seattle chicago new york washington dc and los angeles have done you might think wheeler co would be grateful for us troops restoring some semblance of order in the outofcontrol city nope instead a few days ago the mayor told federal officials “keep your troops in your own buildings or have them leave our city” an invitation to more riots in short that’s why federal police had to step in to restore order radical politicians refused to do their duty we’re seeing similar negligence from the nowopenly socialist democratic party led by house speaker nancy pelosi democrats have expressed their “alarm” at president donald trump daring to enforce the nation’s laws americans should think long and hard before they mark their ballots in november as for portland lawlessness will take its toll on business and the local economy as it inevitably does the city already hit by a wave of pandemic shutdowns will soon face closures due to riots and unrest they’re already happening the anger among some business owners is palpable “i don’t think the majority of socialjustice warriors are truly concerned with justice” said nick zukin who just closed the doors of his portland restaurant mi mero mole “i think they enjoy causing people pain and ‘social justice’ gives them an excuse” so far departures from portland remain largely anecdotal with little hard evidence – yet but as has happened before elsewhere you can expect a flood of businessclosings and relocations in coming months and years as a piece in oregonlivecom noted more than a month into the chaos businesses remain “furious not only at the people who broke into their stores but also at the police for failing to intervene” in june the portland tribune reported 30 million in business losses due to rioting and looting based on a local chamber of commerce survey that includes a bill of more than 6 million in overtime during the riots for local cops meanwhile from march to late june portland accounted for roughly half of all oregon’s jobless claims despite being just 15 of the state’s population things will only get worse as businesses flee this is how cities die by electing ideologues who don’t care about enforcing the law who show contempt for average taxpayers and who impose leftist policies on the local community that damage the economy businesses and residents have been leaving los angeles and san francisco and now they’re walking away from seattle portland may be next it’s already losing population as a recent wall street journal piece notes “in just three months it has become clear that modern urban progressivism is politically incompetent and intellectually incoherent” of course it’s never too late to change course but that’s never been the far left’s strong suit has it — written by the ii editorial board we could use your

sanders and his fellow socialist rep alexandria ocasiocortez say the only way to end poverty in america is to destroy the economic system that made the us the most powerful and prosperous country on earth and the land of opportunity the claim by the senator from vermont and the congresswoman from new york is a dangerous lie that ignores economics history and reality it makes as much sense as telling a family you will burn down their house so they can get a better one – but then failing to build anything of value on top of the ashes after their home goes up in flames sanders and ocasiocortez have become the most prominent faces of a radicalized democratic party that has moved further left than any time in american history not long ago they would have been considered fringe extremists with no chance of winning election to a federal office justin haskins bernie sanders aoc seek disastrous socialist revolution that would devastate america yet incredibly sanders is now a leading contender for the democratic presidential nomination this year and ocasiocortez’s supporters talk about her as a presidential candidate in future years if you pitched hollywood a movie about these socialist comrades 20 years ago no studio would buy it – it would have been considered too crazy to be taken seriously aoc a 30yearold who worked as a bartender before being elected to the congress in 2018 recently complained in a widely publicized interview that too many of her democratic colleagues in congress believe “we can capitalism our way out of poverty” instead aoc sanders and other radical democrats some of whom deny they are socialists but really are argue that they need to supersize government send tax rates skyrocketing and fundamentally transform america into a socialist state to enable people be able to escape poverty as i explained in part i of this column last week that argument has been proven false on numerous occasions over the past 100 years just look at world history since the russian revolution of 1917 almost 70 years after a compassionatesounding theory of economic justice and equality was laid out by karl marx and friedrich engels in “the communist manifesto” in 1848 when communism and socialism jumped from the pages of “the communist manifesto” to become the basis of government in russia and elsewhere tyranny and economic ruin followed in fact marx gave the world the most economically destructive toxic bloodsoaked idea of the 20th century that idea was the marxist belief that important economic decisions should be made by the collective rather than by individuals although ocasiocortez and comrade bernie are not authoritarians like the soviets or communists in china they share that dangerous idea while one socialist society after another collapsed in the postworld war ii years capitalist economies thrived and their people became healthier wealthier and happier than ever before this was true not just in the united states but around the world however this doesn’t mean america’s current conditions are perfect or that our nation is free from suffering more than 38 million americans lived below the poverty line in 2018 – nearly 12 percent of the population the poverty rate did go down in the final years of president barack obama’s administration and under the recent remarkable economic boom experienced under the trump administration but we can and must do much better ocasiocortez sanders and all of the democrats now running for president – including those who don’t identify as fullblown socialists – say that the best way to fix america’s poverty problem is to confiscate wealth from business owners who create jobs as well as other wealthy individuals some democratic politicians have said high taxes should make it impossible for anyone to be a billionaire and would make sure that there are a lot fewer millionaires and that they have a lot less money they sell themselves as modernday robin hoods who supposedly want to rob from the rich to give to the poor – but this time via massive new government programs that would employ legions of taxpayerpaid bureaucrats to do the “robbing” we know from experience that this doesn’t work as the old saying goes the best antipoverty program is a job and as another old saying goes you can’t have employees without employers by taking as much money as they can squeeze out of businesses and wealthy americans the socialists and nearsocialists would suck money out of the economy that could otherwise be used to create jobs that would leave more people dependent on government assistance to survive despite tens of trillions of dollars spent on such programs since the start of president lyndon johnson’s war on poverty in 1964 policymakers have hardly made a dent in america’s poverty problem there’s no question that they meant well but this war is the longest in american history – a fact that ought to make our nation’s leaders and wouldbe leader consider a different battle plan the sad truth is that poverty in many communities – including numerous towns and cities controlled by those who insist bigger government is needed to reduce poverty – are worse off today than they were 50 years ago for example see detroit’s remarkable collapse there are much better ways to improve prosperity than punishing those who have wealth and building gigantic government programs that lock impoverished people into a cycle of dependency here are just two of the many bold ideas that the united states should pursue embracing educational freedom one of the keys to tackling poverty is improving education study after study shows that young people who receive a highquality education are far more likely to rise out of poverty than those who are trapped in failing schools the best and quickest way to improve the us educational system – which has for years been lagging behind comparably wealthy nations around the world – would be to provide all children in the nation with the freedom to attend the school they and their parents choose it is heartbreaking and completely outrageous that millions of students in this country are forced to attend k12 schools that won’t or can’t provide a quality education no child should ever be subjected to a broken school system simply because of his or her zip code the best way to fix this problem is for states to create universal education savings account programs which would empower all parents with the ability to enroll their children in the school that fits their needs – whether that be a private public or home school an evaluation by edchoice of more than 100 empirical studies of school choice programs revealed that the “vast majority of random assignment studies – the goldstandard method in social science – find school choice programs help improve students’ academic performance especially over time” school choice programs have also proven to reduce segregation and improve civic values the essence of the capitalist system that made america the great nation it is today is the belief that competition stimulates improved quality and lower prices if schools had to compete for students they would have to offer improved educational opportunities – and those that failed to do so would close children would benefit from this change – especially lowincome children who now often attend substandard schools help not a handout one of the biggest problems with government poverty programs is that they don’t provide a way for people to escape poverty instead they often trap people in welfare systems by making it difficult or even impossible to stop receiving government aid without losing access to essential services such as health coverage click here to sign up for our opinion newsletter state and city governments can help people in these difficult situations by revising poverty programs so that recipients are able to receive partial benefits – relative to the size of their incomes – as they work and become more selfsufficient poverty programs should also provide all ablebodied enrollees with jobtraining andor access to education programs so that those who are unable to find a job can gain marketable skills while they receive benefits when ablebodied enrollees are required to work or enter job training or education programs they are more likely to find their way out of poverty for example after such requirements were created in arkansas in january 2016 enrollment of ablebodied childless adults in the state’s food stamp program fell by 70 percent even better the families who left arkansas’s welfare program saw their incomes triple according to an analysis by the foundation for government accountability click here to get the fox news app if similar models were adopted across the united states millions of people would move out of poverty just as they did following the welfare reforms created by congress and president bill clinton in the 1990s the way to lower the poverty rate in the united states isn’t to embrace principles that have destroyed nations and led to economic turmoil but rather to embrace the same ideals that made america the economic powerhouse it is today free markets and individual liberty click here to read more by justin haskins

jwix6h,2020-11-18 18:30:27,Republican,Hypocrisy Alert: Obama Won First Election By Challenging Voter Fraud,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/11/hypocrisy_alert_obama_won_first_election_by_challenging_voter_fraud.html,Dale_Gunther,528,72,the first question the fawning scott pelley of 60 minutes asked former president barack obama during their interview this past sunday was this “what is your advice in this moment for president trump” pelley was referring specifically to trump’s continued challenge to the posted results of the november 3rd election “when your time is up then it is your job to put the country first and think beyond your own ego and your own interests and your own disappointments” obama pontificated “my advice to president trump is if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody who put country first it’s time for you to do the same thing” more specifically obama insisted that trump should have conceded no more than two days after the election “when you look at the numbers objectively joe biden will have won handily” obama continued “there is no scenario in which any of those states would turn the other way and certainly not enough to reverse the outcome of the election” although pelley was interviewing obama about his new memoir a promised land neither of the two obviously thought it prudent to share with viewers how obama won his first political campaign a story that obama tells in his new memoir obama’s political rise began with the fall of one mel reynolds a democratic congressman from chicago who made the rookie mistake of getting caught having a sexual relationship with a chatty 16yearold campaign worker this led to his indictment by a cook county grand jury on criminal charges ranging from child pornography to obstruction of justice in chicago given that it takes an indictment to dislodge a sitting member of congress there was a yukonworthy rush to fill this open seat a likely candidate was alice palmer the state senator from obama’s district and something of a mentor to obama as obama tells the story he filed for her senate seat with her blessing once she declared for congress the fact that palmer was a fellow traveler if not an outright communist is a story for another day unfortunately for palmer michelle obama’s family friend jesse jackson jr also decided to file for the seat and bested palmer in the primary like reynolds jackson’s congressional career led straight to the hoosegow in 2013 as the new york times reported “the popular young democratic congressman” was sentenced to 30 months in the slammer and his wife 12 months for living “lavishly” off campaign donations and failing to report more than a half million on their tax returns this apple did not fall far from the jackson family tree having lost in the primary palmer filed anew for her old senate seat and here is where things got sticky for obama “a few of her longtime supporters asked for a meeting and when i showed up they advised me to get out of the race” writes obama “the community couldn’t afford to give up alice’s seniority they said i should be patient my turn would come” obama chose not to think beyond his own ego and his own interests and his own disappointments while trying to rationalize why he should stay in the race two of his supporters showed up “looking like they’d won the lottery” given the prevalence of voter fraud in chicago these veteran pols did need much in the way of luck they just had to know where to look the one supporter said of the signatures on palmer’s petition “they’re terrible worst i’ve ever seen all those negroes who were trying to bully you out of the race they didn’t bother actually doing the work this could get her knocked off the ballot” writes obama “it was true the petitions alice had submitted appeared to be filled with invalid signatures people whose addresses were outside the district multiple signatures with different names but the same handwriting” after months of hearing there is no evidence of voter fraud anywhere young readers have to be shocked to learn just how casually democratic politicians resorted to fraud and still do in cities like chicago when obama wavered about challenging palmer’s signatures a fellow supporter upbraided him “if you let this go you might as well go back to being a professor and whatnot ’cause politics is not for you” she told him “you will get chewed up and won’t be doing anybody a damn bit of good” contrary to the advice he is now giving trump obama did not let it go he filed a challenge with the chicago board of election commissioners not only did the challenge take out palmer but it also eliminated “several other democrats with bad petitions” obama ran unopposed in the democratic primary and faced only token republican opposition in the general election a career was born “whatever vision i had for a more noble kind of politics” writes obama in his memoir “it would have to wait” that day has never come democratic politics in particular remain as mired in corruption as they were when obama first ran for office 25 years ago and he knows this trump has chosen to tackle this swamp monster head on if obama were not such a flaming hypocrite he would applaud the effort “if you let this go” an honest obama would tell trump “you won’t be doing anybody a damn bit of good” jack cashill’s new book unmasking obama the fight to tell the true story of a failed presidency

opponents think hes rude ive seen that he is a patriot who genuinely loves the united states of america and its people even though i had voted for every republican presidential candidate since 1980 i didn’t vote for donald trump in 2016 many republican nominees had been huge disappointments to me and i wasn’t going to vote for yet another gop candidate i thought would betray my trust i couldn’t imagine trump as a genuine conservative who would champion limited government respect individual freedom and liberty and protect the unborn — but was i ever wrong although i didn’t vote for trump in 2016 i would crawl over broken glass to vote for him in 2020 in 2016 i was convinced trump was just another new york liberal on election night however i smiled i was happy that at least hillary clinton wouldn’t be president and i suspected that the next four years with trump would at least be entertaining the primary reason i didn’t vote for trump in 2016 was that i didn’t believe him i didn’t trust that he would be prolife a nonnegotiable issue for me his bluster and bravado didn’t appeal to me i took him literally but not seriously in contrast to his supporters who took him seriously but not literally credit to peter thiel for identifying this significant distinction by the time trump took office i was willing to give him a chance he was the president after all and deserved the opportunity to prove himself during the first year of his presidency i was impressed by his commitment to keeping his campaign promises unlike most politicians by the end of 2017 i classified myself as a trump supporter because of what he had already done as president trump’s list of firstterm accomplishments has been truly impressive building the strongest us economy in my lifetime through historic business and personal tax cuts resulting in millions of jobs created and recordlow unemployment cutting federal government regulations that had a stranglehold on american business innovators and entrepreneurs confronting china’s trade abuses and negotiating fair trade deals with canada mexico south korea and japan eliminating the obamacare individual mandate rebuilding our military through investments in our defense capabilities as well as securing the largest military pay raise in a decade nominating and confirming more solid conservative circuit court judges than any other firstterm administration nominating and fighting for the confirmation of two originalists justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh to the supreme court and then nominating amy coney barrett to fill the vacancy left by the late justice ruth bader ginsburg moving the us embassy in israel to jerusalem and then brokering the abraham accords peace deal between israel the united arab emirates and bahrain consistently fighting democrats to build the wall to secure our southern border reinforcing and repairing hundreds of miles with more construction on the way this is just a brief summary of the trump administration’s accomplishments in addition trump has been the most prolife president in us history he has promoted a culture of life in his domestic policies by supporting prolife pregnancy centers creating the conscience and religious freedom division supporting health workers’ conscience rights and working to defund planned parenthood trump has upheld the same objectives in his foreign policies such as through the global health assistance policy and by ending funding for the proabortion united nations population fund in january 2020 trump became the first us president to attend and address the march for life the trump administration’s accomplishments have been in spite of relentless daily attacks by the mainstream media which act as the pravdalike arm of the democratic party trump derangement syndrome is evident every day on television and online then as details about spygate were revealed in early 2018 i became a fullthroated proponent of trump incensed that the obama administration colluded with clinton the democratic national committee and legacy media to weaponize the federal government intelligence and law enforcement agencies against an opposition party candidate and then a sitting president when the russian collusion hoax didn’t work trump’s enemies tried to take him down with fake impeachment charges over a legitimate phone call with a new ukrainian administration as president trump has largely kept his promises and fought against relentless opposition i don’t care about the tone of his tweets nor if his opponents think he’s rude i’ve seen that he is a patriot who genuinely loves the united states of america and its people i misjudged trump in 2016 but i will do everything i can to see that he is reelected in 2020 — and

other.""",https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/charlie-daniels/charlie-daniels-america-its-time-cool-down,DEYoungRepublicans,524,52,charlie daniels it seems that – for the most part – political dialogue in america has deteriorated from discussion and debate to name calling catfights and oneuppance contests with everybody more intent on having the last word than proving a point we – and i include myself in this group of verbal hyperbolics – instead of responding to some slight of someone on our side with a sensible reason why the accusation is untrue or unfair allow our dander to rise and we come up with some overinflated criticism of something their fairhaired boy or girl has done or said they respond in kind and the incendiary battle is joined waxing more caustic more unproductive and ridiculous in the process then there are those and there are many who don’t even try to be feasible they simply jump to the name calling telling you what a fool or worse you are for believing the way you do without giving any reason whatsoever for what they are so profusely and profanely declaring any attempt at engaging such a person with facts explanations or reason is met with an everincreasingly nasty barrage of fourletter words and at least i have found a total waste of time then there are the “buzzword” people the ones who grab a line from a newscast or a partisan online column and repeat it as if it were carved in stone on mount rushmore even though the validity of what they are repeating is totally unsubstantiated just because hillary clinton came out of the benghazi hearings relatively unscathed there are those who view this as the ultimate proof of her innocence even though four american citizens died without the lifting of a finger to send help the truth of the matter is that hillary clinton was the wrong one to question actually high ranking military commanders should have been put under oath and asked why they didn’t respond and where the order not to respond came from the military people would never come forth on their own considering it a breach of decorum but if subpoenaed they would never even dream of lying under oath and by simply tracing the thread through the ranks the truth could have been arrived at but try telling that to one of hillary’s zealous defenders and you’re more than likely to have your lineage severely questioned accused of being a neanderthal redneck with a misogynistic ax to grind actually i’ll admit the redneck part the misogyny however is totally untrue but i do have an ax to grind and that being after talking to people who were actually on the scene and folks familiar with military logistics and capabilities i know in my heart that in 13 hours’ time all kinds of military response could have been mounted i guess i’m just a voice crying in the wilderness but whatever opinion you may have of my hypothesis i have a right to be heard as do those who disagree with me and neither one of us are going to accomplish anything by calling each other idiots i think one reason for the extreme reticence is that there are those who really don’t want to know the truth if it goes against their persuasions they’d rather continue believing a lie rather than see one of their heroes or cherished convictions destroyed just because people have different opinions about the problems our nation faces and the means and the leaders we need to solve them doesn’t mean that we can’t get along with each other i have longtime employees who believe differently and vote differently than i do and while i disagree with their philosophy they are my brothers and sisters and i love and respect each and every one of them and count them among some of my best friends alan colmes was about as liberal as they come and while we could find very little political common ground to stand on together alan respected my positions i respected his and we always had a lot of fun together on tv and on his radio show my whole point here is that we can – and should – stand by our deeply held beliefs we can – and should – try to pick holes in the other side’s views if we feel differently and be dogged about defending our own it’s just that starting out any discussion by namecalling hyperbole and nasty language immediately puts the other person on the defensive motivating them to respond in kind and all you’re apt to end up with is a cussing match and absolutely nothing constructive gets accomplished i am not pointing fingers as i have been guilty of a toxic gilding of the lily and responding with more heat than any civilized conversation can handle when the battle lines are drawn by ideology the heated rhetoric fanned by an agendadriven media and human nature being what it is it’s hard not to fly off the handle to start with a prejudiced view of the other person’s opinion with a preconceived attitude toward the other person and their point but can we not just let our differences be settled

of ballot collecting or ballot harvesting during two upcoming special elections in the state arguing it stands in direct conflict with social distancing guidelines and newsoms shelterinplace mandate to slow the spread of the coronavirus two weeks ago california republican party chairwoman jessica patterson sent newsom a letter asking him to halt the practice and clarify that his order prohibits collection of ballots but she said newsom did not respond the governor has dodged his responsibility patterson told cbs news were hoping the courts will compel him to clarify she added get breaking news delivered to your inbox patterson accused newsom of avoiding this issue because of a political ploy his party has used to get ahead she added the governor has commented on nearly every aspect of our lives and he cant tell us whether or not ballot harvesting is legal during the stayathome order jessica patterson seen thursday february 21 2019 in sacramento california ap ballot harvesting allows party volunteers or campaign workers to collect mailin ballots from voters and submit them in groups to polling places or election offices in 2016 california expanded the law to allow any person to collect a mailin ballot prior law restricted the practice to just relatives of those or those living in the same household as the voter earlier this week newsoms office declined to comment on this story and after the lawsuit was filed wednesday afternoon a spokesperson for the governor told cbs news they dont typically comment on pending litigation californias secretary of state alex padilla who is also named in the lawsuit and is currently pushing for a 50state votebymail plan ahead of the november presidential election told cbs news this whole debate is nothing but a pretext that republicans use to advance their voter suppression agenda padilla said there is no conflict when it comes to ballot harvesting during the coronavirus pandemic despite a statewide stayathome order that newsom issued in midmarch yes there are numerous public health directives in place padilla acknowledged but at the same time there are fundamental voting rights that are in place and must be protected there is no conflict people can reach out to voters and people can exercise multiple ways of voting while respecting public health directives patterson argued that voters arent leaving their ballots on the front steps and that the practice of ballot harvesting requires an inperson hand off she added that would absolutely violate social distancing if someone is coming to your house and picking up that ballot from you and youre signing it over to them following the 2018 midterm elections after the republicans lost control of the house of representatives some gop leaders raised questions about the security of ballot harvesting while others acknowledged the need to catch up with democrats on the effort patterson said in the last year the state republican party recruited and trained more than 16000 volunteers as neighborhood team leaders and tasked them with developing a trustful relationship with the local communities she acknowledged that republicans used ballot harvesting for the march 3 primary but noted that we live in a very different world than we did in the march primary now top republican officials — including president trump and house minority leader and california congressman kevin mccarthy — are pushing to stop the practice writing in all capital letters earlier this month president trump tweeted that ballot harvesting is rampant with fraud
