ijxoqr,2020-08-31 16:10:48,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Rand Paul attacked by leftist mob screaming ""say her name"", despite introducing bill to ban no-knock raids",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rand-paul-attack-police-arrest-investigation-white-house-rnc-protests,it_is_all_fake_news,918,69,sen rand paul rky told fox friends he believes he would have been killed if not for the police when he and his wife were surrounded and attacked by a mob yelling threats and pushing police upon exiting the white house after president trumps acceptance speech at the republican national convention rnc thursday night it was horrific the republican senator who had part of his lung removed due to a complication from the 2017 assault by his neighbor told host steve doocy of the unhinged mob that continued to get bigger and bigger sen rand paul thanks dc cops for saving him from crazed mob after rnc theyre attempting to push the police over to get to me so at one point they push a policeman backwards he stumbles and hes trying to catch his balance and i catch the back of his flak jacket to stabilize him to make sure hes ok because hes our defense paul explained if hes down the mobs loose on us if not for the police paul said he couldve been killed or recovering in the hospital adding that people followed him into the hotel i truly believe this with every fiber of my being had they gotten at us they would have gotten us to the ground we might not have been killed might just have been injured by being kicked in the head or kicked in the stomach until we were senseless he explained graphic language warning for tweets youve seen the pictures of what they do to you if the police are not there if you defund the police if we become portland if america becomes portland whats going to happen is people are going to be pummeled and kicked in the head and left senseless on the curb he said that would have happened to us i promise you had we not had the dc police to support us we are thankful we have police and weve got to wake up we cant have the whole country we cant have joe biden rule the country and have no police i mean we cant walk down the street in dc safely now thats how bad it is paul was trying to get to his hotel across the street from the white house but it was blocked by protesters so he said the secret service instructed him his wife kelley and two female friends to get on a bus which took 45 minutes to get through all the mobs and then he planned to get an uber to get dropped off at the hotel but the streets were blocked and no one would let them through they were shouting threats to us to kill us to hurt us but also threats saying shout shouting say her name breonna taylor and its like you couldnt reason with this mob but im actually the author of the breonna taylor law to end noknock raids so the irony is lost on these idiots that theyre trying to kill the person whos actually trying to get rid of noknock raids he said paul said hes authored 22 criminal justice reforms with president trump and former president barack obama but the demonstrators were still yelling were not going to let you go alive unless youll say youre for criminal justice reform the pauls were unharmed but the senator is still calling on the fbi to make arrests and conduct an investigation into the interstate criminal traffic being paid for across state lines because people have already been killed in other cities i believe there are going to be people who are involved with the attack on us that actually were paid to come here are not from washington dc and are sort of paid to be anarchists he said this is disturbing because really if youre inciting a riot thats a crime but if youre paying someone to incite a riot that person needs to go to jail as well they were inciting a riot and they would have killed us had the police not been there the senator added he slammed the democratic presidential ticket for violence in democratrun cities its become so dangerous for us and i dont hear joe biden or kamala harris saying one thing about the violence this mob is their voters this is the new democrat party and if we dont resist this the united states is going to become portland were going to become chicago all of these failed cities democrats have run the president said in his speech he said if we allow them to take over the white house we are going to become portland the country will be on fire we have to have law and order and we have to support the police i cant say that strong enough click here to get the fox news app hundreds of protesters had gathered outside the white house on thursday evening as trump prepared to give his speech from the south lawn fencing was set up along the perimeter of the white house to keep protesters away but shouts could be heard from the south lawn protesters yelled “no justice no peace” and “join us” while holding antitrump and black lives matter signs beating drums and playing other music
