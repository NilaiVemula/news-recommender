jpu2rx,2020-11-07 18:45:41,Conservative,AP Has called the election for Joe Biden,https://apnews.com/article/Biden-Trump-US-election-2020-results-fd58df73aa677acb74fce2a69adb71f9,Jibrish,66358,27104,washington ap — democrat joe biden defeated president donald trump to become the 46th president of the united states on saturday and offered himself to the nation as a leader who “seeks not to divide but to unify” a country gripped by a historic pandemic and a confluence of economic and social turmoil “i sought this office to restore the soul of america” biden said in a primetime victory speech not far from his delaware home “and to make america respected around the world again and to unite us here at home” biden crossed the winning threshold of 270 electoral college votes with a win in pennsylvania his victory came after more than three days of uncertainty as election officials sorted through a surge of mailin votes that delayed processing trump refused to concede threatening further legal action on ballot counting but biden used his acceptance speech as an olive branch to those who did not vote for him telling trump voters that he understood their disappointment but adding “let’s give each other a chance” “it’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric to lower the temperature to see each other again to listen to each other again to make progress we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy” he said “we are not enemies we are americans” biden 77 staked his candidacy less on any distinctive political ideology than on galvanizing a broad coalition of voters around the notion that trump posed an existential threat to american democracy the strategy as well as an appeal to americans fatigued by trump’s disruptions and wanting a return to a more traditional presidency proved effective and resulted in pivotal victories in michigan and wisconsin as well as pennsylvania onetime democratic bastions that had flipped to trump in 2016 biden’s victory was a repudiation of trump’s divisive leadership and the presidentelect now inherits a deeply polarized nation grappling with foundational questions of racial justice and economic fairness while in the grips of a virus that has killed more than 236000 americans and reshaped the norms of everyday life kamala harris made history as the first black woman to become vice president an achievement that comes as the us faces a reckoning on racial justice the california senator who is also the first person of south asian descent elected to the vice presidency will become the highestranking woman ever to serve in government four years after trump defeated hillary clinton harris introduced biden at their evening victory celebration as “a president for all americans” who would look to bridge a nation riven with partisanship and she nodded to the historic nature of her ascension to the vice presidency “dream with ambition lead with conviction and see yourselves in a way that others may not simply because they’ve never seen it before” harris told americans “you chose hope and unity decency science and yes truth you ushered in a new day for america” after he spoke the cars at the drivein rally — a pandemic campaign invention — began to honk their horns and a fireworks display lit up the night sky biden was on track to win the national popular vote by more than 4 million a margin that could grow as ballots continue to be counted nonetheless trump was not giving up departing from longstanding democratic tradition and signaling a potentially turbulent transfer of power he issued a combative statement saying his campaign would take unspecified legal actions and he followed up with a bombastic allcaps tweet in which he falsely declared “i won the election got 71000000 legal votes” twitter immediately flagged it as misleading trump has pointed to delays in processing the vote in some states to allege with no evidence that there was fraud and to argue that his rival was trying to seize power — an extraordinary charge by a sitting president trying to sow doubt about a bedrock democratic process trump is the first incumbent president to lose reelection since republican george hw bush in 1992 he was golfing at his virginia country club when he lost the race he stayed out for hours stopping to congratulate a bride as he left and his motorcade returned to the white house to a cacophony of shouts taunts and unfriendly hand gestures in wilmington delaware near the stage that until saturday night had stood empty since it was erected to celebrate on election night people cheered and pumped their fists as the news that the presidential race had been called for the state’s former senator arrived on their cellphones on the nearby water two men in a kayak yelled to a couple paddling by in the opposite direction “joe won they called it” as people on the shore whooped and hollered harris in workout gear was shown on video speaking to biden on the phone exuberantly telling the presidentelect “we did it” across the country there were parties and prayer in new york city spontaneous block parties broke out people ran out of their buildings banging on pots they danced and highfived with strangers amid honking horns among the loudest cheers were those for passing us postal service trucks people streamed into black lives matter plaza near the white house near where trump had ordered the clearing of protesters in june waving signs and taking cellphone pictures in lansing michigan trump supporters and black lives matter demonstrators filled the capitol steps the lyrics to “amazing grace” began to echo through the crowd and trump supporters laid their hands on a counter protester and prayed americans showed deep interest in the presidential race a record 103 million voted early this year opting to avoid waiting in long lines at polling locations during a pandemic with counting continuing in some states biden had already received more than 75 million votes more than any presidential candidate before him advertisement trump’s refusal to concede has no legal implications but it could add to the incoming administration’s challenge of bringing the country together after a bitter election throughout the campaign trump repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power arguing without evidence that the election could be marred by fraud the nation has a long history of presidential candidates peacefully accepting the outcome of elections dating back to 1800 when john adams conceded to his rival thomas jefferson it was biden’s native pennsylvania that put him over the top the state he invoked throughout the campaign to connect with working class voters he also won nevada on saturday pushing his total to 290 electoral college votes biden received congratulations from dozens of world leaders and his former boss president barack obama saluted him in a statement declaring the nation was “fortunate that joe’s got what it takes to be president and already carries himself that way” republicans on capitol hill were giving trump and his campaign space to consider all their legal options it was a precarious balance for trump’s allies as they try to be supportive of the president and avoid risking further fallout but face the reality of the vote count on saturday senate majority leader mitch mcconnell had not yet made any public statements either congratulating biden or joining trump’s complaints but retiring gop sen lamar alexander of tennessee who is close to mcconnell said “after counting every valid vote and allowing courts to resolve disputes it is important to respect and promptly accept the result” more than 237000 americans have died during the coronavirus pandemic nearly 10 million have been infected and millions of jobs have been lost the final days of the campaign played out against a surge in confirmed cases in nearly every state including battlegrounds such as wisconsin that swung to biden the pandemic will soon be biden’s to tame and he campaigned pledging a big government response akin to what franklin d roosevelt oversaw with the new deal during the depression of the 1930s he announced that as his transition kicks into high gear he would on monday appoint his own coronavirus task force but senate republicans fought back several democratic challengers and looked to retain a fragile majority that could serve as a check on some of biden’s ambitions the 2020 campaign was a referendum on trump’s handling of the pandemic which has shuttered schools across the nation disrupted businesses and raised questions about the feasibility of family gatherings heading into the holidays the fast spread of the coronavirus transformed political rallies from standard campaign fare to gatherings that were potential public health emergencies it also contributed to an unprecedented shift to voting early and by mail and prompted biden to dramatically scale back his travel and events to comply with restrictions the president defied calls for caution and ultimately contracted the disease himself trump was saddled throughout the year by negative assessments from the public of his handling of the pandemic there was another covid19 outbreak in the white house this week which sickened his chief of staff mark meadows biden also drew a sharp contrast to trump through a summer of unrest over the police killings of black americans including breonna taylor in kentucky and george floyd in minneapolis their deaths sparked the largest racial protest movement since the civil rights era biden responded by acknowledging the racism that pervades american life while trump emphasized his support of police and pivoted to a “law and order” message that resonated with his largely white base the third president to be impeached though acquitted in the senate trump will leave office having left an indelible imprint in a tenure defined by the shattering of white house norms and a daytoday whirlwind of turnover partisan divide and twitter blasts trump’s team has filed a smattering of lawsuits in battleground states some of which were immediately rebuffed by judges his personal lawyer rudy giuliani was holding a news conference in philadelphia threatening more legal action when the race was called biden born in scranton pennsylvania and raised in delaware was one of the youngest candidates ever elected to the senate before he took office his wife and daughter were killed and his two sons badly injured in a 1972 car crash commuting every night on a train from washington back to wilmington biden fashioned an everyman political persona to go along with powerful senate positions including chairman of the senate judiciary and foreign relations committees some aspects of his record drew critical scrutiny from fellow democrats including his support for the 1994 crime bill his vote for the 2003 iraq war and his management of the clarence thomas’ supreme court hearings biden’s 1988 presidential campaign was done in by plagiarism allegations and his next bid in 2008 ended quietly but later that year he was tapped to be barack obama’s running mate and he became an influential vice president steering the administration’s outreach to both capitol hill and iraq while his reputation was burnished by his time in office and his deep friendship with obama biden stood aside for clinton and opted not to run in 2016 after his adult son beau died of brain cancer the year before trump’s tenure pushed biden to make one more run as he declared that “the very soul of the nation is at stake” full coverage election 2020

j106fp,2020-09-28 01:24:03,Conservative,"NY Times: Trump paid $750 in US income taxes in 2016, 2017",https://apnews.com/f0e2af5f9f99de9d30dc6b9097121188,pookamatic,18944,10201,president donald trump paid just 750 in federal income taxes the year he ran for president and in his first year in the white house according to a report sunday in the new york times trump who has fiercely guarded his tax filings and is the only president in modern times not to make them public paid no federal income taxes in 10 of the past 15 years the details of the tax filings complicate trump’s description of himself as a shrewd and patriotic businessman revealing instead a series of financial losses and income from abroad that could come into conflict with his responsibilities as president the president’s financial disclosures indicated he earned at least 4349 million in 2018 but the tax filings reported a 474 million loss the tax filings also illustrate how a reputed billionaire could pay little to nothing in taxes while someone in the middle class could pay substantially more than him roughly half of americans pay no income taxes primarily because of how low their incomes are but irs figures indicate that the average tax filer paid roughly 12200 in 2017 about 16 times more than what the president paid the disclosure which the times said comes from tax return data it obtained extending over two decades comes at a pivotal moment ahead of the first presidential debate tuesday and weeks before a divisive election against democrat joe biden speaking at a news conference sunday at the white house trump dismissed the report as “fake news” and maintained he has paid taxes though he gave no specifics he also vowed that information about his taxes “will all be revealed” but he offered no timeline for the disclosure and made similar promises during the 2016 campaign on which he never followed through in fact the president has fielded court challenges against those seeking access to his returns including the us house which is suing to get trump’s tax returns as part of congressional oversight during his first two years as president trump received 73 million from foreign operations which in addition to his golf properties in scotland and ireland included 3 million from the philippines 23 million from india and 1 million from turkey among other nations the president in 2017 paid 145400 in taxes in india and 156824 in the philippines compared to just 750 in us income taxes the times said the tax records did not reveal any unreported connections to russia trump found multiple ways to reduce his tax bills he has taken tax deductions on personal expenses such as housing aircraft and 70000 to style his hair while he filmed “the apprentice” losses in the property businesses solely owned and managed by trump appear to have offset income from his stake in “the apprentice” and other entities with multiple owners during the first two years of his presidency trump relied on business tax credits to reduce his tax obligations the times said 97 million worth of business investment credits that were submitted after trump requested an extension to file his taxes allowed him to offset his obligations and pay just 750 each in 2016 and 2017 income tax payments help finance the military and domestic programs trump starting in 2010 claimed and received an income tax refund that totaled 729 million which the times said was at the core of an ongoing audit by the irs the times said a ruling against trump could cost him 100 million or more the president could also face mounting financial pressure in the years ahead the tax records show he’s carrying a total of 421 million in loans and debt that are primarily due within four years most of that debt comes from the doral golf resort in florida 125 million and trump’s washington hotel 160 million two properties that the times said are struggling financially full coverage donald trump richard neal dmass the chair of the house ways and means committee who has tried unsuccessfully to obtain trump’s tax records said the times report makes it even more essential for his committee to get the documents “it appears that the president has gamed the tax code to his advantage and used legal fights to delay or avoid paying what he owes” neal wrote in a statement “now donald trump is the boss of the agency he considers an adversary it is essential that the irs’s presidential audit program remain free of interference” a lawyer for the trump organization alan garten and a spokesperson for the trump organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the associated press on the report advertisement garten told the times that “most if not all of the facts appear to be inaccurate” he said in a statement to the news organization that the president “has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015” the new york times said it declined to provide garten with the tax filings in order to protect its sources but it said its sources had legal access to the records during his first general election debate against democrat hillary clinton in 2016 clinton said that perhaps trump wasn’t releasing his tax returns because he had paid nothing in federal taxes trump interrupted her to say “that makes me smart”

enlarge this image toggle caption shuran huangnpr shuran huangnpr follow nprs coverage of ginsburgs death and the political aftermath here justice ruth bader ginsburg the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal cultural and feminist icon died friday the supreme court announced her death saying the cause was complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas the court in a statement said ginsburg died at her home in washington dc surrounded by family she was 87 our nation has lost a justice of historic stature chief justice john roberts said we at the supreme court have lost a cherished colleague today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember ruth bader ginsburg as we knew her a tireless and resolute champion of justice architect of the legal fight for womens rights in the 1970s ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nations highest court becoming its most prominent member her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her and it thrusts the supreme court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign just days before her death as her strength waned ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter clara spera my most fervent wish is that i will not be replaced until a new president is installed she knew what was to come ginsburgs death will have profound consequences for the court and the country inside the court not only is the leader of the liberal wing gone but with the court about to open a new term the chief justice no longer holds the controlling vote in closely contested cases though roberts has a consistently conservative record in most cases he has split from fellow conservatives in a few important ones this year casting his vote with liberals for instance to protect at least temporarily the socalled dreamers from deportation by the trump administration to uphold a major abortion precedent and to uphold bans on large church gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic but with ginsburg gone there is no clear court majority for those outcomes npr youtube upcoming political battle indeed a week after the upcoming presidential election the court is for the third time scheduled to hear a challenge brought by republicans to the affordable care act known as obamacare in 2012 the high court upheld the law in a 54 ruling with roberts casting the deciding vote and writing the opinion for the majority but this time the outcome may well be different thats because ginsburgs death gives republicans the chance to tighten their grip on the court with another appointment by president trump so conservatives would have 63 majority and that would mean that even a defection on the right would leave conservatives with enough votes to prevail in the obamacare case and many others at the center of the battle to achieve that will be senate majority leader mitch mcconnell in 2016 he took a step unprecedented in modern times he refused for nearly a year to allow any consideration of president barack obamas supreme court nominee back then mcconnells justification was the upcoming presidential election which he said would allow voters a chance to weigh in on what kind of justice they wanted but now with the tables turned mcconnell has made clear he will not follow the same course instead he will try immediately to push through a trump nominee so as to ensure a conservative justice to fill ginsburgs liberal shoes even if trump were to lose his reelection bid asked what he would do in circumstances such as these mcconnell said oh wed fill it so what happens in the coming weeks will be bareknuckle politics writ large on the stage of a presidential election it will be a fight ginsburg had hoped to

way the world is for american women for more than a decade until her first judicial appointment in 1980 she led the fight in the courts for gender equality when she began her legal crusade women were treated by law differently from men hundreds of state and federal laws restricted what women could do barring them from jobs rights and even from jury service by the time she donned judicial robes however ginsburg had worked a revolution that was never more evident than in 1996 when as a relatively new supreme court justice ginsburg wrote the courts 71 opinion declaring that the virginia military institute could no longer remain an allmale institution true ginsburg said most women — indeed most men — would not want to meet the rigorous demands of vmi but the state she said could not exclude women who could meet those demands reliance on overbroad generalizations estimates about the way most men or most women are will not suffice to deny opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description ginsburg wrote she was an unlikely pioneer a diminutive and shy woman whose soft voice and large glasses hid an intellect and attitude that as one colleague put it was tough as nails by the time she was in her 80s she had become something of a rock star to women of all ages she was the subject of a hit documentary a biopic an operetta merchandise galore featuring her notorious rbg moniker a time magazine cover and regular saturday night live sketches on one occasion in 2016 ginsburg got herself into trouble and later publicly apologized for disparaging remarks she made about thenpresidential candidate trump but for the most part ginsburg enjoyed her fame and maintained a sense of humor about herself asked about the fact that she had apparently fallen asleep during the 2015 state of the union address ginsburg did not take the fifth admitting that although she had vowed not to drink at dinner with the other justices before the speech the wine had just been too good to resist the result she said was that she was perhaps not an entirely sober judge and kept nodding off the road to law born in brooklyn ruth bader went to public schools where she excelled as a student — and as a baton twirler by all accounts it was her mother who was the driving force in her young life but celia bader died of cancer the day before the future justice would graduate from high school then 17 ruth bader went on to cornell university on a full scholarship where she met martin aka marty ginsburg what made marty so overwhelmingly attractive to me was that he cared that i had a brain she said after her graduation they were married and went off to fort sill okla for his military service there mrs ginsburg despite scoring high on the civil service exam could only get a job as a typist and when she became pregnant she lost even that job two years later the couple returned to the east coast to attend harvard law school she was one of only nine women in a class of more than 500 and found the dean asking her why she was taking up a place that should go to a man at harvard she was the academic star not her husband the couple were busy juggling schedules and their toddler when marty ginsburg was diagnosed with testicular cancer surgeries and aggressive radiation followed so that left ruth with a 3yearold child a fairly sick husband the law review classes to attend and feeding me marty ginsburg said in a 1993 interview with npr the experience also taught the future justice that sleep was a luxury during the year of her husbands illness he was only able to eat late at night after that he would dictate his senior class paper to her at about 2 am he would go back to sleep ruth bader ginsburg recalled in an npr interview then id take out the books and start reading what i needed to be prepared for classes the next day marty ginsburg survived graduated and got a job in new york his wife a year behind him in school transferred to columbia where she graduated at the top of her law school class despite her academic achievements the doors to law firms were closed to women and though recommended for a supreme court clerkship she wasnt even interviewed it was bad enough that she was a woman she recalled later but she was also a mother and male judges worried she would be diverted by her familial obligations a mentor law professor gerald gunther finally got her a clerkship in new york by promising judge edmund palmieri that if she couldnt do the work he would provide someone who could that was the carrot ginsburg would say later the stick was that gunther who regularly fed his best students to palmieri told the judge that if he didnt take ginsburg gunther would never send him a clerk again the ginsburg clerkship apparently was a success palmieri kept her not for the usual one year but two from 195961 ginsburgs next path is rarely talked about mainly because it doesnt fit the narrative she learned swedish so she could work with anders bruzelius a swedish civil procedure scholar through the columbia university school of law project on international procedure ginsburg and bruzelius coauthored a book in 1963 ginsburg finally landed a teaching job at rutgers law school where she at one point hid her second pregnancy by wearing her motherinlaws clothes the ruse worked her contract was renewed before her baby was born while at rutgers she began her work fighting gender discrimination the mother brief her first big case was a challenge to a law that barred a colorado man named charles moritz from taking a tax deduction for the care of his 89yearold mother the irs said the deduction by statute could only be claimed by women or widowed or divorced men but moritz had never married the tax court concluded that the internal revenue code was immune to constitutional challenge a notion that tax lawyer marty ginsburg viewed as preposterous the two ginsburgs took on the case — he from the tax perspective she from the constitutional one according to marty ginsburg for his wife this was the mother brief she had to think through all the issues and how to fix the inequity the solution was to ask the court not to invalidate the statute but to apply it equally to both sexes she won in the lower courts amazingly he recalled in a 1993 npr interview the government petitioned the us supreme court stating that the decision cast a cloud of unconstitutionality over literally hundreds of federal statutes and it attached a list of those statutes which it compiled with defense department computers those laws marty ginsburg added were the statutes that my wife then litigated to overturn over the next decade in 1971 she would write her first supreme court brief in the case of reed v reed ruth bader ginsburg represented sally reed who thought she should be the executor of her sons estate instead of her exhusband the constitutional issue was whether a state could automatically prefer men over women as executors of estates the answer from the allmale supreme court no it was the first time the court had struck down a state law because it discriminated based on gender and that was just the beginning enlarge this image toggle caption manuel balce cenetaap manuel balce cenetaap by then ginsburg was earning quite a reputation she would become the first female tenured professor at columbia law school and she would found the womens rights project at the american civil liberties union as the chief architect of the battle for womens legal rights ginsburg devised a strategy that was characteristically cautious precise and singlemindedly aimed at one goal winning knowing that she had to persuade male establishmentoriented judges she often picked male plaintiffs and she liked social security cases because they illustrated how discrimination against women can harm men for example in weinberger v wiesenfeld she represented a man whose wife the principal breadwinner died in childbirth the husband sought survivors benefits to care for his child but under the thenexisting social security law only widows not widowers were entitled to such benefits this absolute exclusion based on gender per se operates to the disadvantage of female workers their surviving spouses and their children ginsburg told the justices at oral argument the supreme court would ultimately agree as it did in five of the six cases she argued over the years ginsburg would file dozens of briefs seeking to persuade the courts that the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection applies not just to racial and ethnic minorities but to women as well in an interview with npr she explained the legal theory that she eventually sold to the supreme court the words of the 14th amendments equal protection clause — nor shall any state deny to any person the equal protection of the laws well that word any person covers women as well as men and the supreme court woke up to that reality in 1971 ginsburg said during these pioneering years ginsburg would often work through the night as she had during law school but by this time she had two children and she later liked to tell a story about the lesson she learned when her son in grade school seemed to have a proclivity for getting into trouble the scrapes were hardly major and ginsburg grew exasperated by demands from school administrators that she come in to discuss her sons alleged misbehavior finally there came a day when she had had enough i had stayed up all night the night before and i said to the principal this child has two parents please alternate calls after that she found the calls were few and far between it seemed she said that most infractions were not worth calling a busy husband about the supreme courts second woman in 1980 president jimmy carter named ginsburg to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit over the next 13 years she would amass a record as something of a centrist liberal and in 1993 president bill clinton nominated her to the supreme court the second woman appointed to the position she was not first on his list for months clinton flirted with other potential nominees and some womens rights activists withheld their active support because they were worried about ginsburgs views on abortion she had been publicly critical of the legal reasoning in roe v wade but in the background marty ginsburg was lobbying hard for his wife and finally ruth ginsburg was invited for a meeting with the president as one white house official put it afterward clinton fell for her — hook line and sinker so did the senate she was confirmed by a 963 vote once on the court ginsburg was an example of a woman who defied stereotypes though she looked tiny and frail she rode horses well into her 70s and even went parasailing at home it was her husband who was the chef indeed a master chef while the justice cheerfully acknowledged she was an awful cook though a liberal she and the courts conservative icon antonin scalia who died in 2016 were the closest of friends indeed an opera called scaliaginsburg is based on their legal disagreements and their affection for each other toggle caption susan walshap over the years as ginsburgs place on the court grew in seniority so did her role in 2006 as the court veered right after the retirement of justice sandra day oconnor ginsburg dissented more often and more assertively her most passionate dissents coming in womens rights cases dissenting in ledbetter v goodyear in 2007 she called on congress to pass legislation that would override a court decision that drastically limited back pay available for victims of employment discrimination the resulting legislation was the first bill passed in 2009 after obama took office in 2014 she dissented fiercely in burwell v hobby lobby a decision that allowed some forprofit companies to refuse on religious grounds to comply with a federal mandate to cover birth control in health care plans such an exemption she said would deny legions of women who do not hold their employers beliefs access to contraceptive coverage where she asked is the stopping point suppose it offends an employers religious belief to pay the minimum wage or to accord women equal pay and in 2013 when the court struck down a key provision of the voting rights act contending that times had changed and the law was no longer needed ginsburg dissented she said that throwing out the provision when it has worked and is continuing to work is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet she viewed her dissents as a chance to persuade a future court some of my favorite opinions are dissenting opinions ginsburg told npr i will not live to see what becomes of them but i remain hopeful and yet ginsburg still managed some unexpected victories by winning over one or two of the conservative justices in important cases in 2015 for example she authored the courts decision upholding independent redistricting commissions established by voter referenda as a way of removing some of the partisanship in drawing legislative district lines ginsburg always kept a backbreaking schedule of public appearances both at home and abroad even after five bouts with cancer colon cancer in 1999 pancreatic cancer 10 years later lung cancer in 2018 and then pancreatic cancer again in 2019 and liver lesions in 2020 during that time she endured chemotherapy radiation and in the last years of her life terrible pain from shingles that never went away completely all who knew her admired her grit in 2009 three weeks after major cancer surgery she surprised everyone when she showed up for the state of the union address shortly after that she was back on the bench it was her husband marty who told her she could do it even when she thought she could not she told npr a year later her psychological toughness was on full display when her beloved husband of 56 years was mortally ill as she packed up his things at the hospital before taking him home to die she found a note he had written to her my dearest ruth it began you are the only person i have ever loved setting aside children and family i have admired and loved you almost since the day we first met at cornell the time has come for me to take leave of life because the loss of quality simply overwhelms i hope you will support where i come out but i understand you may not i will not love you a jot less shortly after that marty ginsburg died at home the next day his wife the justice was on the bench reading an important opinion she had authored for the court she was there she said because marty would have wanted it years later she would read the letter aloud in an npr interview and at the end choke down the tears in the years after martys death she would persevere without him maintaining a jampacked schedule when she was not on the bench or working on opinions some liberals criticized her for not retiring while obama was president but she was at the top of her game enjoyed her work enormously and feared that republicans might not confirm a successor she was an avid consumer of opera literature and modern art but in the end it was her work she said that sustained her i do think that i was born under a very bright star she said in an npr interview because if you think about my life i get out of law school i have top grades no law firm in the city of new york will hire me i end up teaching it gave me time to devote to the movement for evening out the rights of women and men and it was that legal crusade for womens rights that ultimately led to her appointment to the us supreme court to the end of her tenure she remained a special kind of feminist both decorous and dogged

between december 2019 and july 2020 trump discussed the threat of the coronavirus with a level of detail that he had not yet acknowledged to the public noting feb 7 that it was deadly stuff and more

challenges its important to express confidence its important to express calm mcenany told reporters the president has never lied to the american public on covid mcenany said the president was

endorsed maskwearing as patriotic in july it goes through air bob trump told woodward in february thats always tougher than the touch you dont have to touch things right but the air you just breathe the air and thats how its passed on march 19 the same day he told woodward he was downplaying the virus to prevent panic and over a month after marveling at how easily the virus spread trump said during a white house briefing that the virus surprised the whole world and if people would have known about it it could have stopped – been stopped in place it could have been stopped right where it came from – china – if we would have known about it if they would have known about it its so easily transmissible you wouldnt even believe it he told woodward on april 13 cnn reported three days later the white house was releasing guidelines on how to start reopening the country after coronavirus shutdowns he also told woodward in march that the virus posed a greater risk to young people than was initially thought plenty of young people he said he has told americans repeatedly that children are at low risk as he pushed for schools to reopen the same day in february that trump acknowledged to woodward this is deadly stuff he tweeted that with warmer weather the virus hopefully becomes weaker and then gone after a conversation with president xi jinping of china cnn and the washington post reported that woodward writes robert obrien national security adviser informed trump on jan 28 that the coronavirus would be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency that got trumps attention according to woodward trump told woodward in may that he didnt recall obrien saying that but said im sure he said it nice guy trump declared certain travel restrictions on china a few days after obriens reported remarks experts warned that trumps downplaying of the virus might have a negative impact on americans efforts to curb the spread but trump has largely blamed china for the spread of the virus in the united states the virus has nothing to do with me trump told woodward in july its not my fault its – china let the damn virus out democratic nominee joe biden slammed trump

is responsible for deaths because of his downplaying to the public what he said about the virus early on he understood better than he let on when he was calling it a hoax his delay distortion and

election,https://www.fox13news.com/news/barr-no-evidence-of-fraud-thatd-change-election-outcome,StackLeeAdams,10285,3428,article attorney general william barr said tuesday the justice department has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election his comments come despite president donald trumps repeated claims that the election was stolen and his refusal to concede his loss to presidentelect joe biden in an interview with the associated press barr said us attorneys and fbi agents have been working to follow up specific complaints and information they’ve received but they’ve uncovered no evidence that would change the outcome of the election related 2020 election was ‘most secure in american history according to cisa committees “to date we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election” barr told the ap advertisement the comments are especially direct coming from barr who has been one of the presidents most ardent allies before the election he had repeatedly raised the notion that mailin voter fraud could be especially vulnerable to fraud during the coronavirus pandemic as americans feared going to polls and instead chose to vote by mail last month barr issued a directive to us attorneys across the country allowing them to pursue any “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities if they existed before the 2020 presidential election was certified despite no evidence at that time of widespread fraud that memorandum gave prosecutors the ability to go around longstanding justice department policy that normally would prohibit such overt actions before the election was certified soon after it was issued the department’s top elections crime official announced he would step aside from that position because of the memo trumps legal team responded to barrs comments with all due respect to the attorney general there hasn’t been any semblance of a department of justice investigation we have gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states which they have not examined we have many witnesses swearing under oath they saw crimes being committed in connection with voter fraud as far as we know not a single one has been interviewed by the doj the justice department also hasn’t audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth the statement read the trump campaign team led by rudy giuliani has been alleging a widespread conspiracy by democrats to dump millions of illegal votes into the system with no evidence they have filed multiple lawsuits in battleground states alleging that partisan poll watchers didn’t have a clear enough view at polling sites in some locations and therefore something illegal must have happened the claims have been repeatedly dismissed including by republican judges who have ruled the suits lacked evidence local republicans in some battleground states have followed trump in making similar unsupported claims related president trump fires top cybersecurity official over election dispute trump has railed against the election in tweets and in interviews though his own administration has said the 2020 election was the most secure ever trump recently allowed his administration to begin the transition over to biden but has still refused to admit he lost the issues trump’s campaign and its allies have pointed to are typical in every election problems with signatures secrecy envelopes and postal marks on mailin ballots as well as the potential for a small number of ballots miscast or lost but theyve also requested federal probes into the claims attorney sidney powell has spun fictional tales of election systems flipping votes german servers storing us voting information and election software created in venezuela “at the direction of hugo chavez” – the late venezuelan president who died in 2013 powell has since been removed from the legal team after an interview she gave where she threatened to “blow up” georgia with a “biblical” court filing related trump campaign files lawsuit in wisconsin after requested recount barr didnt name powell specifically but said theres been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results and the dhs and doj have looked into that and so far we haven’t seen anything to substantiate that” barr said he said people were confusing the use of the federal criminal justice system with allegations that should be made in civil lawsuits he said such a remedy for those complaints would be a topdown audit conducted by state or local officials not the us justice department related election 2020 lawsuits filed recounts requested by trump campaign — here’s where they stand “there’s a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fixall and people don’t like something they want the department of justice to come in and ‘investigate’” barr said he said first of all there must be a basis to believe there is a crime to investigate “most claims of fraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct they are not systemic allegations and and those have been run down they are being run down” barr said “some have been broad and potentially cover a few thousand votes they have been followed up on

scaremonger senator lindsey graham is working on a bill that could coerce tech companies to stop providing endtoend encryption by threatening them with massive legal liability the eliminating abusive and rampant neglect of interactive technologies act of 2019 or earn it act advertisement the draft version of the earn it act which has not yet been formally introduced but is reportedly being circulated by graham and democratic senator richard blumenthal bills itself as a way to fight the distribution of child sex abuse material csam on major platforms but it does so by threatening section 230 a core building block of the modern internet that shields tech platforms from liability for usergenerated content for example it’s why gizmodo is insulated from libel lawsuits stemming from what happens in the comments section the earn it act would threaten tech companies like facebook google and whatapp’s section 230 immunity regarding csam unless they comply with a set of socalled “best practices” determined by a 15member commission those companies deemed not in compliance would have the evidentiary standard used to determine whether they enable csam lowered from “knowingly” to “recklessly” with the draft bill also amending section 230 to no longer prohibit state prosecutors from pursuing criminal charges against internet companies currently protected from state laws under the statute advertisement this is a disconcerting proposal for numerous reasons as riana pfefferkorn of stanford university’s center for internet and society explained in a lengthy blog post it appears to be a baitandswitch for congress and the department of justice to wage their war on endtoend encryption by requiring those “best practices” to “condemn endtoend encryption” unlike telecommunications firms like phone companies internet platforms are exempted under federal law from having to provide the ability for law enforcement to wiretap their networks the earn it act provides a convenient workaround to bypass that tech companies already can be held civilly and criminally liable for csam on their networks under federal law i f they don’t comply with chapter 110 of title 18 of the us code sections 2258a and 2258b those sections implement requirements that platforms alert authorities and preserve evidence when they discover csam providing them with legal protection if they do all of the major platforms comply with section 2258 pfefferkorn wrote and generally only underground operators involved in trafficking csam don’t the draft version of the earn it act ignores that section 2258 already provides a way for the feds to hold tech platforms accountable instead it ravages the separate section 230 immunity for csam unless they comply with those “best practices” the 15member commission that would design those “best practices” would include four law enforcement representatives four tech industry reps two reps of child safety organizations and two computer scientistssoftware engineering experts moreover the us attorney general would have the power to unilaterally overrule the commission’s rulings at any time and substitute their preferred list in other words do what we say or we’ll take away your shield from liability in civil and state criminal claims about child abuse the bill does provide recourse in that tech companies can ignore the commission or ag’s requirements and implement their own “reasonable measures” a vaguely worded provision that pfefferkorn noted would have to be duked out in court advertisement it doesn’t take a genius to see where this is going the federal government and especially the doj have wanted tech companies to build surveillance backdoors into their endtoend encrypted messaging services for years they insist that they are only interested in preventing major crimes like terrorism or sex trafficking but in reality building those backdoors would create a convenient pipeline for domestic surveillance under the earn it act an unaccountable 15member commission or the attorney general currently antiencryption fanatic bill barr could claim that endtoend encryption goes against “best practices” and punish platforms that use it they could also claim that the “best practices” are to build those surveillance backdoors—which would expose the content of those networks to anyone who discovered them not just the us government what isn’t clear is whether the act would be a big enough cudgel to force tech companies to comply as it only revokes section 230 protections as they apply to csam jeff kosseff a cybersecurity professor at the us naval academy and author of the section 23 book the twentysix words that created the internet told gizmodo via phone advertisement “what this bill is saying is for these specific types of lawsuits and criminal prosecutions you wouldn’t get section 230 protections unless you comply with the guidelines” kosseff said “i’m not sure how big of a threat this type of lawsuit or prosecution would be for the platforms to get them to—to make that tradeoff” “the other thing to keep in mind is that section 230 by its terms does cover private messaging” kosseff added “it’s ‘interactive computer services’ and that would cover messaging private email that sort of thing but in reality there’s only been a few cases where section 230 has actually been applied by courts for private messaging so there are a lot of endtoend encryption messaging providers that frankly don’t care all that much about section 230 i think the platforms that would care the most would be the ones that have both publicfacing platforms where section 230 matters as well as messaging services” advertisement advertisement eric goldman a professor at santa clara university school of law called the graham bill a “confusing mess” that strains to link perceived issues surrounding endtoend encryption with criticism of section 230 “there’s like six different moving parts to it it’s kind of like a 4d chess move to see how we get from endtoend encryption all the way back to section 230 for a federal crime that’s already not covered by 230” he said adding “the whole structure of the earn it act is kind of the wrong framing” advertisement “let’s assume for a moment that the unavailability of section 230 is effectively a death sentence for most companies” added goldman “it’s a fast road to bankruptcy so is that the right remedy for whatever missteps a company might make” there’s other issues with the draft bill as well both goldman and kosseff said it was unclear whether whatsapp which is owned by facebook would have to comply with the earn it act for facebook the platform to receive full section 230 protections the draft bill also concentrates power in the attorney general’s office in a manner that might not even be legal and leaves room for next to no input from tech companies advertisement “the idea that congress can delegate virtually unilaterial authority to the attorney general to make rules is confusing” goldman said “i’m not an expert in procedure but i’m not sure that’s even possible the absolute power in the ag’s hands to disregard the recommendations of the commission makes the commission a form of theater i think i don’t understand why go through the exercise if the ag can just do whatever he or she wants” “the composition of the committee is so structurally biased against most of the internet ecosystem that it’s not possible to really believe it would ever speak for the internet in a useful way” goldman added “the internet is far more than google or facebook and so the fact that there’d be two voices for the entire rest of the internet it’s really kind of baffling how anyone thinks that would be helpful” advertisement pfefferkorn argues that because the feds can already punish tech companies that don’t do enough to fight csam under sections 2258a2258b there’s no reason to target section 230 other than that it’s taken center stage in politically motivated battles over online speech and censorship “this bill is a cynical ploy to exploit current antisection 230 sentiment in order to achieve an unrelated antiencryption goal one which by the way would be disastrous for cybersecurity privacy the economy national security” pfefferkorn wrote “congress should not kill the freedom to encrypt by taking advantage of section 230’s current unpopularity to get away with a baitandswitch” advertisement blumenthal hasn’t currently signed on to the draft version of the bill according to bloomberg the news agency noted that while the current opposition to encryption is bipartisan it’s unclear whether congress would risk passing the earn it act during an election year when the assuredly heavy opposition to it could pose an immediate political price

jv6ihs,2020-11-16 15:12:47,Conservative,Trump laying groundwork for full US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan before leaving office,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/trump-laying-groundwork-for-full-us-troop-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-before-leaving-office,bobbyw24,8518,4791,‘all wars must end’ in what was labeled as his initial message to all defense department employees acting defense secretary christopher miller walked a fine line hinting that he may be ordered to oversee the withdrawal of the remaining us troops in afghanistan something president trump said in an oct 7 tweet should happen by christmas “this fight has been long our sacrifices have been enormous and many are weary of war — im one of them — but this is the critical phase in which we transition our efforts from a leadership to supporting role” wrote miller a former green beret “we are not a people of perpetual war — it is the antithesis of everything for which we stand and for which our ancestors fought all wars must end” ‘this war isnt over’ at the same time miller admitted that al qaeda has not yet been vanquished but was vague about whether defeating al qaeda in afghanistan would require a continued troop presence in the country as advocated by presidentelect joe biden “this war isnt over” miller wrote “we are on the verge of defeating al qaeda and its associates but we must avoid our past strategic error of failing to see the fight through to the finish” esper opposed hasty withdrawal by firing mark esper last week and installing retired army col douglas macgregor as chief adviser to miller trump swept away the civilian leaders who would resist a withdrawal before the taliban makes good on its pledge to reduce violence and negotiate in good faith with the usbacked afghan government according to the washington post esper sent a classified memo to the white house this month expressing concerns about additional cuts “conditions on the ground were not yet right” esper reportedly argued citing “the ongoing violence possible dangers to the remaining troops in the event of a rapid pullout potential damage to alliances and apprehension about undercutting the negotiations” macgregor a frequent fox news contributor is among those who argue its long past time for the us to get out of afghanistan after 19 years of war no new directive “there is no new mission directive — nothing has changed” a senior white house official told the washington examiner’s jerry dunleavy the official with knowledge of the recent moves at the pentagon said the goal is to fulfill trump’s longtime promises to kill bad guys free american hostages held overseas and wind down us combat troop levels around the world especially in afghanistan “he wants to bring the troops home he wants to end the wars” the official said logistics logistics logistics it’s an axiom of warfighting that battles are won by logistics and the logistical problem of pulling 4000 to 5000 troops and their equipment out of afghanistan in less than ten weeks may be the one thing that stymies trump’s desire to complete the pullout before he leaves office “the president needs to recognize that battlefield reality doesnt often comport with a political calendar if he wants troops out of afghanistan as i know most americans do we have to do it in a way that makes sense in an orderly manner and that comports with battlefield reality” said former homeland security secretary jeh johnson on abc’s this week “and you know donald trump the dealmaker should also appreciate that in trying to strike a deal you dont unilaterally surrender your greatest point of leverage by unilaterally withdrawing troops before the afghan government and the taliban have stuck a deal” good monday morning and welcome to jamie mcintyre’s daily on defense written and compiled by washington examiner national security

by some of america’s recently retired fourstar commanders “simply saying ‘everyone home by christmas’ and pulling the last few thousand troops out of afghan has emotional appeal but makes no sense” tweeted retired adm james staviridis former supreme nato commander “we are close to a peace agreement — cutting out now will crater it” “nobody wants ‘endless wars’ including ‘the generals’ never met one who does especially those of us who have children serving this country” tweeted former special operations commander retired gen tony thomas “the discussion less cliche should be is have we achieved the end state of sustainable security so that we never have another 911” let the transition begin the top democrat on the senate armed services committee is part of the chorus of trump critics who argue that the president is harming national security by delaying cooperation with the biden transition team “no one likes to lose but president trump is recklessly and pointlessly blocking the transition to protect his own ego” said rhode island sen jack reed in a statement “the reality is joe biden won with a recordbreaking number of votes and president trump’s blockade on information and resources only makes the country less safe and puts more people’s health at risk” “president trump’s baseless conspiracy theories and failure to recognize basic facts are further evidence of his lack of respect for our democracy and an insult to the american people” reed said “presidentelect biden must be given access to highlevel intelligence briefings and all the other transition resources he needs to ensure a smooth complete peaceful transition of power” ‘i concede nothing’ as tens of thousands of trump supporters rallied in washington trump tweeted that biden’s victory was a sham “he only won in the eyes of the fake news media i concede nothing we have a long way to go this was a rigged election” last week a statement from the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency called the nov 3 election “the most secure in american history” the demise of al qaedas no 2 as first reported by the new york times and corroborated by other news organizations including the associated press the united states and israel worked together to assassinate abu mohammed al masri al qaeda’s no 2 in tehran aug 7 the anniversary of the 1998 embassy attacks in africa he was accused of plotting “around 900 on a warm summer night he was driving his white renault l90 sedan with his daughter near his home when two gunmen on a motorcycle drew up beside him five shots were fired from a pistol fitted with a silencer four bullets entered the car through the driver’s side and a fifth hit a nearby car” the new york times reported in a 20tweet long thread on twitter the foundation for the defense of democracies’ thomas joscelyn editor of the long war journal lays out some of the background behind the killing of al masri who has long been on the fbi’s most wanted list “weve suspected that the us increased its efforts to take out senior alqaeda leaders across multiple countries this year abu muhammad almasri is one in a string of operatives to perish in recent months but he was the most senior” joscelyn writes noting “on 917 christopher miller then nctc director now acting secdef told congress that ‘several’ of alqaedas ‘remaining senior leaders continue to find safe haven in iran and will likely play a key role in the group’s efforts to reconstitute its leadership’” space force commander back space force gen david thompson the vice

the past several months including ongoing discussions with me and my colleagues across the united states government” he added that he spoke with “key leaders in congress as well as our allies and partners abroad to update them on these plans” earlier in the day ahead of millers announcement a senior defense official told reporters that the drawdown was a “collaborative decision but would not say which military leaders had recommended the plan the official also would not say which conditions had been met by the taliban to warrant such a drawdown in afghanistan but insisted that us national security will not be threatened and the troops remaining overseas will still be able to assist allies and partners in afghanistan and iraq the remaining 2500 troops “can accomplish everything we have been doing” the official said the drawdown order — which contradicts months of previous advice from top defense officials — comes a week after trump fired defense secretary mark esper mark esperisis task force director resigns from pentagon post in continued postelection purge the perils of a us troop drawdown to the afghan army and tribes acting defense secretary makes surprise trip to somalia more and replaced him with miller esper’s ouster also set off a leadership purge at the pentagon with several of those positions now filled by trump loyalists advertisement the departures appeared to help clear the way for trump to order the hasty drawdown as the military has long argued against going below 4500 troops in afghanistan conditions on the ground do not warrant a further drawdown they have said as the taliban has failed to uphold its agreement with the united states for peace in the country days before trump fired esper for example the pentagon head sent a classified memo to the president advising that the conditions were not sufficient in afghanistan for any further troop withdrawals as it could possibly undermine peace talks the washington post reported the senior defense official on tuesday would not address the document telling reporters we’re not going to comment on any memo that you may or may not have in your possession” the official also insisted that there is no contradiction with the president and his national security cabinet” the sentiment that a further drawdown wouldnt be prudent was repeated in a pentagon watchdog report released only hours before trumps order which found that the taliban has conducted a “small number” of attacks against usled coalition forces in afghanistan despite its february agreement with the administration banning such attacks the operation freedom’s sentinel inspector general report marks the first official confirmation that the taliban has launched attacks against coalition forces in violation of the ustaliban deal further highlighting the discrepancy between tuesdays announcement and previous military opinion the pentagon told the inspector general that once it reached 4500 troops in afghanistan it would “pause troop reductions and assess the situation” national security adviser robert o’brien briefly addressed the drawdowns at the white house on tuesday telling reporters that the decision fulfilled trump’s campaign promise to bring an end to america’s “endless wars” “four years ago president trump ran on a promise to put a stop to america’s endless wars” o’brien said “president trump is keeping that promise to the american people” he confirmed the troop reduction by midjanuary with the remaining forces meant to defend embassies and other government facilities and diplomats and deter foes “by may it is president trumps hope that they will all come home safely and in their entirety” o’brien said “i want to reiterate that this policy is not new this has been the president’s policy since he took office” o’brien also said he had just spoken to nato secretary general jens stoltenberg regarding the alliance’s contributions to national security and security of overseas missions like those in iraq and afghanistan while trump has long promised to return us troops stateside he announced early in his presidency that he would increase troop levels in afghanistan from 8600 to roughly 14000 at the advice of military advisers advertisement since then his administration has moved to lower that number and in february officials signed a conditional peace deal with the taliban that calls for a full us withdrawal by may if the group upholds certain commitments such as denying safe haven to al qaeda since the deal was signed however the taliban has stepped up attacks against afghan forces which us officials have repeatedly condemned as threatening the peace process officials have also warned that further drawdowns without a show from the taliban that they are adhering to the agreement will weaken the us position in peace talks the senior defense official insisted on tuesday that despite the drawdown talks with the taliban “are still very much ongoing our goal is the peace deal

the same time the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high the united states has had forces in afghanistan since october 2001 after the 911 terror attacks seeking to

measure scholarly aptitude or native intelligence independent of social and educational background to the contrary sat scores are highly correlated with wealth the higher your family income the higher

come from a family with an annual income greater than 200000 your chance of scoring above 1400 out of 1600 is one in five if you come from a poor family less than 20000 per year your chance is one in

privileged are boosted by the use of private test prep courses and tutors some in places like manhattan charge as much as 1000 per hour for oneonone tutoring as meritocratic competition for college admission has intensified in recent decades tutoring and test prep has become a billiondollar industry for years the college board which administers the sat insisted that its test measured aptitude and that scores were unaffected by tutoring it recently dropped that pretense and entered a partnership with the khan academy to provide free online sat practice to all test takers although this was a worthy undertaking it did little to level the testprep playing field as college board officials hoped and claimed it would unsurprisingly perhaps students from families with higher incomes and education levels made greater use of the online help than did students from disadvantaged backgrounds resulting in an even greater scoring gap between the privileged and the rest for james bryant conant an american chemist and former president of harvard university a test of aptitude or iq held promise as a democratic measure of academic ability untainted by educational disadvantage and the vagaries of high school grades this is why he opted for the sat to choose his scholarship students he would be surprised to learn that high school grades are better than sat scores at identifying lowincome students who are likely to succeed in college while high school grades are to some extent correlated with family income sat scores are more so this is partly because contrary to longstanding claims by the testing industry the sat is coachable private tutoring helps and a profitable industry has arisen to teach high school students the gimmicks and tricks to boost their scores also read ivy league universities offer free online courses amid covid19 lockdown meritocracy entrenches inequality second the system of meritocratic admission that conant promoted did not lead to the classless society he hoped it would produce inequalities of income and wealth have deepened since the 1940s and 1950s and the social mobility that conant saw as the remedy for a stratified society has not come about the haves and havenots have not been trading places from one generation to the next as we have seen relatively few children of the poor rise to affluence and relatively few children of affluence fall below the ranks of the uppermiddle class notwithstanding the american dream of rising from rags to riches upward mobility is less common in the united states than in many european countries and there is no evidence of improvement in recent decades the favoritism that harvard yale and princeton long accorded young men from upperclass boarding schools receded in the 1960s and 1970s so did the routine admission to ivy league colleges of any minimally qualified son of an alumnus academic standards improved and median sat scores increased the bestendowed colleges and universities adopted needblind admissions and generous financialaid policies removing a major financial barrier for promising students of modest means these are the undeniable achievements and yet the meritocratic revolution in higher education did not bring about the social mobility and broad opportunity that its early proponents expected and that educational leaders and politicians continue to promise america’s selective colleges and universities ousted the complacent entitled hereditary elite that worried conant but this aristocracy of inherited privilege has given way to a meritocratic elite that is now as privileged and entrenched as the one it replaced though far more inclusive in terms of gender race and ethnicity this meritocratic elite has not produced a fluid mobile society instead today’s credentialed professional classes have figured out how to pass their privileges on to their children not by bequeathing them large estates but by equipping them with the advantages that determine success in a meritocratic society notwithstanding its newfound role as the arbiter of opportunity and the engine of upward mobility higher education has not provided a significant counterweight to the rising inequality of recent times consider the class composition of higher education today especially in its most selective domains most students at selective colleges and universities are from affluent families very few are from lowincome backgrounds more than 70 percent of those who attend the hundred or so most competitive colleges in the united states come from the top quarter of the income scale only 3 percent come from the bottom quarter the wealth gap in college enrollment is most acute at the top at ivy league colleges stanford duke and other prestigious places there are more students from the wealthiest 1 percent of families than from the entire bottom half of the country at yale and princeton only about one student in fifty comes from a poor family bottom 20 percent if you come from a rich family top 1 percent your chances of attending an ivy league school are 77 times greater than if you come from a poor family bottom 20 percent most young

two decades elite private colleges have offered more generous financial aid and the federal government has increased college funding for students of modest means harvard and stanford for example now provide free tuition room and board to any student whose family makes less than 65000 per year despite these measures however the share of students from lowincome families at selective colleges has changed little since 2000 and in some cases has drifted downward the percentage of “first generation” students the first in their families to attend college at harvard today is no higher than it was in 1960 jerome karabel the author of a history of admissions policies at harvard yale and princeton concludes that “the children of the working class and the poor are about as unlikely to attend the big three harvard yale and princeton today as they were in 1954” why elite colleges are not engines of mobility the academic reputations scientific contributions and rich educational offerings of america’s leading colleges and universities are admired throughout the world but these institutions are not effective engines of upward mobility recently the economist raj chetty and a team of colleagues undertook a comprehensive study of the role of colleges in promoting intergenerational mobility examining the economic trajectory of 30 million college students from 1999 to 2013 for each college in the united states they calculated the proportion of its students who rose from the bottom rung on the income ladder to the top ie from the bottom quintile to the top quintile they asked in other words what proportion of students at each college came from a poor family but wound up earning enough to reach the top 20 percent their finding higher education today does surprisingly little to promote upward mobility this is especially true at elite private colleges although attending a place like harvard or princeton does give a poor kid a good chance of rising such places enroll so few poor kids to begin with that their mobility rate is low only 18 percent of harvard students and only 13 percent at princeton rise from the bottom to the top of the income scale one might expect things to be different at the major public universities but they too enroll so many alreadyaffluent students that they contribute little to upward mobility taken together the 1800 colleges and universities chetty studied—private and public selective and nonselective—enabled fewer than 2 percent of their students to rise from the bottom fifth of the income scale to the top fifth some might ask whether propelling students in one generation from the bottom quintile 20000 family income or less to the top 110000 income or more is too demanding a test of mobility but even more modest ascents are relatively rare at elite private colleges and universities only about one student in ten manages to rise even two rungs two quintiles on the income ladder american colleges and universities enable surprisingly few students to rise despite the fact that attending such places does enhance one’s economic prospects college graduates especially from prestigious places do have a major edge in landing lucrative jobs but these schools have little impact on upward mobility because most of their students are welloff in the first place american higher education is like an elevator in a building that

hur once said “every calculation based on experience elsewhere fails in new mexico”in so many ways wallace was prescient about this beautiful poor and unique state in the american southwest one “calculation” about modern politics that would especially perplex him is the fact that a relatively poor but oilrich western state elects politicians that are so directly at odds with its economic best interestafter texas and north dakota new mexico is the thirdlargest oilproducing state in the us the oil and gas industries combine to generate roughly 40 percent of its annual budget furthermore new mexico’s oil and gas resources are heavily concentrated on lands managed by the federal government the central role of energy especially energy extracted within the state’s borders and controlled by federal policymakers might lead one to believe that new mexicans would vote for proenergy republicans in federal electionsinstead new mexico has become a safely blue state it narrowly went for george w bush in 2004 but since then has gone for democrats by wide margins the situation is even more stark at the state level where democrats have had “trifectas” total control of both houses and the governor’s mansion for 60 of the past 90 years the gop hasn’t had such governing authority in the state for a single year since 1931 and despite significant turnover has not elected a republican to the us senate since pete domenici retired in 2009in 2020 biden won the state 543 percent to 435 percent despite the fact that president trump’s proenergy policies have been a boon to the new mexico economy and that the biden administration’s energy policies are a dagger aimed at the heart of new mexico’s economythat “dagger” comes in the form of the numerous sometimes clear often conflicting statements that candidate biden made during the campaign it is unclear what biden will do about hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” which enables oil and gas producers to access previously inaccessible oil and gas sources he backed away from an outright nationwide ban late in the campaign however biden has clearly stated that he would ban new gas and oil permits including fracking on federal landstargeting federal lands would devastate new mexico’s oil and gas industry and its economy because of the state’s large federal estate according to the institute for energy research 347 percent of the land in new mexico is federal in fiscal year 2019 new mexico received energyrelated disbursement from the federal bureau of land management of 117 billion the highest payment made in any state wyoming was next with 641 million and then colorado with 108 million this was the highest payment from the bureau in the state’s history and compares with 455 million in fy 2017 a vast majority of this increased revenue is a result of frackingfurthermore data from the global energy institute indicate that if energy production on federal lands were banned new mexico would lose 24300 jobs 10000 direct 14300 indirect and induced a significant hit for a state with a workforce of around 900000 making matters worse a good number of the “direct” jobs lost are goodpaying something that is not easy to find in new mexico a state that consistently ranks among the poorest in the nation and has been hardhit by the covid19 pandemic closing new mexico’s federal lands to energy production entirely would cost the state 496 million in annual royalty collections representing 8 percent of the state’s total general fund revenuesbiden’s proposed fracking ban is even too much for new mexico’s democratic governor michelle lujan grisham who has said that she’ll ask for an exemption from any future drilling ban acknowledging the taxrevenue contributions to education funding grisham explained to the new mexico oil and gas association conference in santa fe last october that “without the energy effort in this state no one gets to make education the top priority”to be sure lujan grisham is broadly supportive of biden’s energy policies she’s even on the presidentelect’s short list for administration positions both of them have stated that they would like to “transition out of fossil fuels” despite new mexico’s financial dependence on the industrybut biden’s aggressive antifossilfuels stance as it relates to federal land not only puts him at odds with lujan grisham it puts him far to the left of president obama on the issue in a 2012 presidential debate obama stated “we’ve opened up public lands we’re actually drilling more on public lands than the previous administration and natural gas isn’t just appearing magically we’re encouraging it and working with the industry”president obama was of course considered an environmentalist by political opponents and supporters alike his support for naturalgas right isn’t difficult to reconcile with his environmental track record that’s because when used in a new power plants natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less co2 than a typical new coal plantobama understood the vast benefits of natural gas including the fact that it was appropriate to drill for it on federal lands during his tenure naturalgas production rose some 35 percent from approximately 21 million cubic feet to more than 284 million cubic feetif he truly cares about the environment biden would be wise to follow his predecessor’s playbook according to the epa us net greenhousegas emissions went down by 10 percent from 2005 to 2018 and much of the contribution to that decline in recent years was “due to an increasing shift to use of less carbon dioxideintensive natural gas for generating electricity and a rapid increase in the use of renewable energy in the electric power sector” but if naturalgas prices rise and a ban on federal leasing is likely to contribute to higher prices these positive developments could go into reverse the energy information administration recently projected that higher naturalgas prices would cause coal’s share of power generation to increase from 18 percent to 22 percent in 2021obama also signed into law legislation that ended the us government’s restrictions on crudeoil exports back in 2015during the campaign biden faced tremendous pressure from the left wing of his political base to come out for policies such the green new deal and bans on fracking and other fossilfuelbased energy production biden has never been associated with such hardleft stances against economic policy and growth in the past remember even obama is to the right of where biden campaignedlets hope that president biden has a more realistic approach to energy than did candidate biden new mexico’s economic future is certainly at stake but so is the recovery of our nation’s virushobbled economyrather than instituting a blanket ban on production of oil and gas on federal lands a better approach would be to recognize the benefits and work to make sure that any production is handled responsibly and safely the growing american energy sector and american energy independence have delivered wins for the environment for consumers and for the us and state economies such as new mexico’s let’s keep it that way

sex trafficking of girls at his upper east side mansion and his home in palm beach florida some of the charges date back to the early 2000s epstein pleaded not guilty to the charges he faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted following news of his death his alleged victims condemned his apparent suicide and what they described as a lack of justice for them and other accusers i am extremely mad and hurt thinking he once again thought he was above us and took the easy way out i still cant wrap my head around the fact thats really true jenalisa jones 30 an alleged victim of epstein when she

and enablers i am angry jeffrey epstein won’t have to face his survivors of his abuse in court we have to live with the scars of his actions for the rest of our lives while he will never face the consequences of the crimes he committed the pain and trauma he caused so many people araoz said michelle licata an alleged florida victim of epstein when she was 16 said she didnt want anyone to die i just wanted him to be held accountable for his actions simple as that she said manhattan us attorney geoffrey s berman said in a statement that the investigation of epsteins alleged conduct remains

said in a statement he was appalled at the news and the inspector general is opening an investigation into epsteins death in addition to the fbis investigation mr epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered he said politicians too demanded answers in the wake of epsteins death lois frankel a democratic congressman who represents palm beach said his death does not end the need for justice for his victims or the right of the public to know why a prolific child molester got a slap on the wrist instead of a long prison sentence rep alexandria ocasiocortez dny wrote on twitter we need answers lots of them his alleged crimes were thrown back into the spotlight amid renewed scrutiny of the plea deal epstein reached with the us attorney’s office in miami in 2007 led by thenus attorney alexander acosta a nonprosecution agreement allowed epstein a hedgefund manager to plead guilty to two state charges and avoid federal charges for an allegedly broad pattern of similar sexual misconduct he would serve just 13 months of an 18month sentence in county jail in florida the plea deal is currently under review by the justice department’s office of professional responsibility the alleged victims told abc news they were not made aware of the details of the plea agreement while it was being negotiated a lawyer for courtney wild one of the women in that case urged other victims to still come forward with their own allegations despite epsteins death “the victims deserved to see epstein held accountable and he owed it to everyone he hurt to accept responsibility for all of the pain he caused” brad edwards a fort lauderdale attorney who represents several alleged victims including wild said “we will continue to represent his victims and will not stop in their pursuit of finality and justice” on friday a federal appellate court in new york unsealed around 2000 pages of documents from a nowsettled civil defamation case between virginia roberts giuffre an alleged epstein victim and british socialite ghislaine maxwell a longtime epstein associate giuffre accused maxwell of recruiting her while she was working as a lockerroom attendant at maralago in 2000 and bringing her to epsteins home for a massage she claims that she eventually became a teen sex slave to epstein and a victim of sex trafficking beginning at age 17 at the hands of both epstein and maxwell the newlyunsealed documents showed that giuffre alleged that epstein and maxwell directed her to have sex with among others prince andrew criminal defense attorney alan dershowitz former new mexico governor bill richardson former senator george mitchell a wellknown prime minster who she wouldnt name and a foreign man who was introduced to her as a prince maxwell has consistently denied giuffres claims ghislaine maxwell did not participate in facilitate manage or otherwise conspire to commit sex trafficking as alleged by giuffre her attorney wrote in a 2016 court filing maxwells attorneys also contend in the newly unsealed court filings that giuffre had “utterly failed” to substantiate her allegations that maxwell facilitated her abuse giuffre’s claims about having been trafficked to other prominent men maxwell’s lawyers wrote are “patently incredible” mitchell and richardson denied the claims both said in statement they have never met giuffre prince andrew had previously denied the allegations giuffres allegations were never tested in court because the case was settled prior to trial after news broke that epstein died sigrid mccawley a lawyer for giuffre said the timing of his apparent suicide was “no coincidence” “we are hopeful that the government will continue to investigate and will focus on those who participated and facilitated epsteins horrifying sex trafficking scheme that damaged so many” mccawley said in a statement “the victims await the true justice they have sought and deserve” during a detention hearing in july epstein came facetoface with two other accusers annie farmer said she was 16 when epstein had her sent to new mexico where he was allegedly “inappropriate” with her courtney wild told the judge she was 14 when

handouts to foreign companies — especially when they're only foreign to avoid U.S. taxes and laws.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/04/06/no-tax-evading-cruise-lines-shouldnt-get-handouts-from-uncle-sam/,guanaco55,7094,373,american taxpayers don’t love handouts to american corporations but they really hate handouts to foreign companies — especially when theyre only foreign to avoid us taxes and laws for the past 75 years shipping companies owned by americans and europeans have stopped registering their ships in those countries and instead have had them fly “flags of convenience” by listing their ships on the registries of nations such as liberia panama the marshall islands and others they have avoided labor laws registration fees environmental regulations and taxes the practice allowed these companies to operate more profitably at the expense of the workers they employed and the treasuries of the nations in which they operated the moves were legal even encouraged by some in the american government over the years now that the bottom has fallen out of the tourism industry thanks to the wuhan coronavirus outbreak these companies — many of which keep their main offices in the united states despite their foreign registry — are crying redwhiteandblue tears as the financial stimulus congress passed last week excluded them after decades of shirking responsibilities cruise ship companies’ comeuppance is long overdue if they want a handout now let them ask someone else for it flying ‘flags of convenience’ isn’t new ships once flew the flag of the nation in which they were based merchant ships sometimes used false flags in wartime but the first modern peacetime shenanigans of this sort came during prohibition as american ships adopted flags of convenience to aid in rumrunning the former uss zafiro a decommissioned navy coal ship owned by a collection of americans and canadians was renamed the belen quezada in 1919 and registered in panama thus began a tradition of ship owners pretending to be foreign to avoid the consequences of their own nations’ laws an article by adam green in the economist’s magazine 1843 tells the rest of the story many american vessels would follow suit dry cruise ships were worried about losing out to their european competitors who could serve alcohol to passengers and shipping companies wished to evade america’s increasingly strict labour laws panama’s shipping registry continued to balloon in the 1930s with an eclectic mix of new entrants from danzig oil tankers to norwegian whalers from greek weapons smugglers to a shortlived pirate radio station operating off the coast of los angeles it wasn’t long before the financial services industry took notice of panama’s laissezfaire regulatory regime in 1927 wall street helped panama pass a series of laws that allowed anyone to form anonymous taxfree corporations with few questions asked other nations soon got in on panama’s game professor elizabeth r desombre wrote in her 2006 book “flagging standards” that the liberian ship registry was promoted by former us secretary of state edward stettinius as a costeffective registry for oil tankers the marshall islands’ registry desombre noted is not even based in the marshall islands it is run by a successor to stettinius’ company out of an office in reston virginia ruledodging has consequences this is all a way for shipping companies to dodge taxes avoid regulations hire nonunion maritime labor and scoff at environmental laws the biggest tradeoff until now has been the loss of corporate citizenship that once guaranteed a ship’s home nation would protect it since the end of the second world war though american and allied navies have been dedicated to the freedom of the seas as a broader concept not just for their own merchant vessels keeping international waters open and free of piracy has been the west’s gift to the world regardless of ship registry the tradeoffs here are not unlike those facing all of american industry we impose a lot of rules — rules to protect workers rules to protect investors rules to protect the environment and taxes to pay for it all but we also keep an open door to the world meaning the rational economic reaction to those rules is often to take one’s business elsewhere free trade lets corporations abandon their american workforce this way open shipping registries make the task even easier for cruise ship owners congress talks tough but gives business an easy way out effectively it has encouraged this sort of behavior stettinius was no rogue freebooter he was a former cabinet official and ambassador with ties to america’s richest men and most powerful corporations his liberian venture had the blessing — and often the participation — of these people and organizations similar to the bipartisan free trade consensus that prevailed until recently the people it hurt such as maritime labor were ignored and their numbers dwindled nobody likes handouts to foreign companies these shipping companies are now recognizing another tradeoff american taxpayers don’t love handouts to american corporations but they really hate handouts to foreign companies and if those “foreign” companies only became foreign to avoid american taxes and laws it’s a heavy lift for any politician to say such a company should get money from the taxes of american workers and american companies that actually stayed here republican sen josh hawley of missouri has expressed opposition to a foreign cruise line bailout last week in response to a news story about the companies he tweeted “come back to america and pay your taxes how about that” president trump echoed hawley’s concerns two days later at a news conference “i do like the concept” he said “of perhaps coming in and registering here coming into the united states it’s very tough to make a loan to a company when they’re based in a different country” democrats agreed with hawley and trump on the issue rep hakeem jeffries of new york tweeted “the major cruise lines sail under foreign flags to avoid paying the us corporate tax rate and now some want the american taxpayer to bail them out get lost” rep peter a defazio of oregon also a democrat said the same “they aren’t american they don’t pay taxes in the united states of america” the current epidemic has produced a few examples of bipartisan cooperation and this is one of them no one — democrat republican or independent — wants to give taxpayer money to companies that fled our nation to save money and avoid regulation trump has said that while he opposes bailing them out directly “the cruise line business is very important” and “we can’t let the cruise lines go out of business” fortunately we may not have to do anything to save them although they are excluded from federal loan guarantees they still can borrow money from banks and the banks appear ready to lend according to bloomberg news carnival corporation is in talks with bankers to raise billions in bond issuances all without the help of uncle sam that would be a

Up,https://pjmedia.com/columns/megan-fox/2020/11/06/trump-campaign-says-it-has-evidence-of-voter-fraud-its-time-to-put-up-or-shut-up-n1129212,-mylankovic-,6812,1395,the decision desk hq prematurely called the 2020 presidential election for joe biden on friday the trump campaign is alleging all kinds of voter fraud but short of some bad behavior like messing with poll watchers and telling them where they can stand we haven’t seen any hard evidence we sure feel like we know what happened here and it would be nice to have the proof but proof is hard to come by when it’s election fraud once the mailin and absentee ballots are separated from their envelopes there’s no way to know where they came from voter fraud has been happening for a very long time but it’s not “widespread” texas got all its 11 million votes counted and its returns submitted with no problems whatsoever so did most of the country what we do have is a system that ensures people who want to cheat can do it rather easily while there’s no proof it was done it’s genius we’ve confused our voting system so badly with early voting and several different ways to vote computer ballot harvesting paper ballot punch cards mailin that there is ample opportunity for individual counties in important swing states to increase the number of votes substantially without anyone knowing or being able to prove it but trump should have seen this coming we’ve been watching the blatant irregularities for years remember brenda snipes in broward county the sun sentinal does you only need a few precincts like this to sway an election your way it doesn’t have to be widespread we can identify the worst suspects right now clark county nev broward county fla which was not a problem this year but should still be audited cook county ill detroit mich phoenix ariz and philadelphia pennsylvania i may have missed a couple but off the top of my head those are places we know have had problems in the past but no one ever does anything about it the fake news word of the day is widespread as in there is no evidence of widespread fraud fraud only needed to happen in a few places to matter — scott adams scottadamssays november 6 2020 and the main reason no one ever does anything is that voter fraud is really hard to prove we all see the secretive and weird behavior of ballot counters we question where all these new ballots are coming from days after the election when the whole damn country has already turned in all their votes we see poll watchers being thrown out of polling places but nothing is ever done none of these places are ever investigated congress has made no laws strengthening our election process if you know this is happening but you do nothing about it how am i supposed to be upset for you there’s no excuse our election process hasn’t been reformed in all these many years that this has been going on our leaders must want it like this and i’m including the gop they had control of the house and the senate in the ’90s and could have fixed this they didn’t they did nothing uncover it now today or this thing is over if there is proof then show it and do it fast you have every network calling you a liar because you arent showing the evidence put it up or this thing is over httpstco5glsdgqlbn — megan fox meganfoxwriter november 6 2020 if the trump campaign does not have hard evidence they can kiss it goodbye what are they waiting for if they have it biden’s second term if you have it release it and let’s get this sorted out but if there is no evidence you just got rolled by the democrats…knowing they would do this winners get evidence and frankly if republicans are too stupid to have set up safeguards put insiders in these places or had any plan to stop the usual shenanigans then they deserve to lose all i’ve seen so far are irregularities and bad behavior i can’t determine what happened or if anything can be done about it now no one is going to care about it except republicans there are some things that can and should be litigated such as a judge allowing votes to be counted for three more days in pennsylvania when the legislature is supposed to legislate election law but the courts decided to do it for them but is that fraud or is that just another blow to our election processes like early voting and not verifying voters with photo id both of which were done through legal means court decisions are the definition of legal means that’s not to say courts can’t act illegally and that’s why it can and will be litigated any place where vote tallies are within the margin for a recount should be recounted we should use all available means to make sure that the votes were legally cast but i don’t like hearing trump and his campaign shouting “fraud” from the rooftops without providing the evidence also videos of random election place activities are not evidence of fraud yes it appears that some people are sitting at a table and filling out ballots but we don’t know what they are doing they could be duplicating damaged ballots or those might not even be ballots so if someone is going to allege that they were filling out ballots illegally then show the evidence i’m getting increasingly annoyed by the minute that the trump campaign is not coming out with substantial evidence to shut up brian williams who is repeatedly calling trump a liar as are all the other news media people like jim acosta if you could shut this down with evidence you would wouldn’t you what are you waiting for i don’t doubt that fraud happened in this election as it does in every election but without proof it won’t matter msnbc is the first network to pull away from trumps speech after he says if you count the legal votes i easily win brian williams there are no illegal votes that we know of there has been no trump victory that we know of pictwittercomsnzhlr8vfj — justin baragona justinbaragona november 5 2020 the game the media and democrats are playing is working they aren’t wrong to demand evidence of voter fraud if that’s what you are alleging rumors and unexplained videos aren’t going to cut it the media will not report any credible allegations of fraud even if it exists they’re going to continue denying it until enough people in the country believe them the media have proven they can suppress valid stories even when there is a mountain of evidence showing their veracity such as the hunter biden laptop story or they can amplify any fake stories such as the “fine people hoax” and make you believe it’s true they own the narrative it’s going to take some kind of nuclear bomb of evidence to break that hold a fight between poll watchers and poll workers in one precinct isn’t going to be that bomb i strongly encourage the gop to come out with their dossier showing the evidence that there was election fraud without that this thing is over and we should move forward without putting the country through more agony and no matter what outcome we have here we need to address the failings in our voting system immediately and without delay or there will be no point in ever voting in such an illegitimate system again

some point when the election chaos is finally settled congress will likely turn to passing another covid19 stimulusrelief bill despite the last one being plagued by rampant fraud and dysfunction one starting point for negotiations will be the “heroes act” a 22 trillion bill the house passed in october on a partyline vote by speaker of the house nancy pelosi and her fellow democrats one of the most significant aspects of the heroes act is that it allocates nearly 700 billion in federal money for state local and tribal governments proponents say this gives localities the funds they need to pay emergency responders and fund programs necessary to protect their communities critics point out that much of this money is used to “bail out” blue states that were already mismanaging their budgets and running up large unfunded pension programs before the pandemic indeed the leftleaning brookings institution has projected that “state and local government revenues will decline 155 billion in 2020 167 billion in 2021 and 145 billion in 2022” simple math shows us that the cares act gives states and localities hundreds of billions more in federal money than they are actually projected to lose due to pandemicrelated decreases in revenue this alone should be a red flag yet a new analysis also reveals that pelosi and her fellow “progressives” snuck millions of dollars in cash for some of the nation’s wealthiest zip codes into their emergency covid19 package breaking house speaker nancy pelosis heroes act allocated huge coronavirus bailouts to many wealthy places in the country should the american taxpayers from lowerincome areas be subsidizing the lifestyles of the rich and famous httpstco0vl5v56zmw — openthebooks openthebooks november 12 2020 watchdogs from openthebookscom inspected the fine print of the heroes act and found that it allocates 350 million to the 50 richest communities in america the average annual income in these areas ranged from 262988 to 525324 “it’s unclear why such wealthy neighborhoods need so much money to weather the storm” adam andrzejewski of openthebookscom wrote “should american taxpayers from lowerincome areas be subsidizing the lifestyles of the rich and famouspelosi and her fellow progressives snuck millions of dollars in cash for some of the nation’s wealthiest zip codes into their emergency covid19 package some might reasonably look at a figure like 350 million and conclude that in the context of a 22 trillion bill it is a relatively small amount of money but we mustnt forget that this figure is only looking at a tiny sample size it is not all the money this bill allocates to wealthy zip codes just a snapshot we can extrapolate from this figure that the heroes act would dole out many hundreds of millions if not billions more to other wealthy towns and cities it’s not even the only provision of the bill that can be fairly characterized as a handout for the rich the package also includes items such as student debt relief which further burdens cashstrapped taxpayers yet only helps a relatively welleducated and welloff subset of society but wait aren’t democrats supposed to be the progressive party fighting for the working class that’s certainly what their rhetoric would suggest yet the democrats included cash handouts for wealthy constituents in predominantly liberal areas such as wellesley mass malibu california and old greenwich conn in their emergency response package nonetheless this offers another painful reminder that government officials—no matter their professed partisan or ideological principles—will always and inevitably end up wielding their power in a manner prone to favoritism and clientelism “there is no such thing as a just and fair method of exercising the tremendous power that interventionism puts into the hands of the legislature and the executive” austrian economist ludwig von mises wrote “in many fields of the administration of interventionist measures favoritism simply cannot be avoided”government officials—no matter their professed partisan or ideological principles—will always and inevitably end up wielding their power in a manner prone to favoritism and clientelism humans are fallible beings—and power corrupts this is why from tax loopholes to crony regulations to spending bills sweeping government interventions will always end up skewing in favor of powerful constituencies however when power is left to the individual level rather than government that decentralization helps limit abuses it’s not a matter of electing the right people fundamentally progressive and conservative government officials alike face the same incentive structures the only way to really prevent the abuse of government power and expenditure of taxpayer resources in favor of the welloff and wellconnected is to limit the scope of the government itself

its covid19 restrictions arguing that they broach the first amendment’s protections on the ability to worship freely strip clubs have also gone to court arguing the limitations curb their right to free speech the latter group has succeeded which might be the most california thing ever in a ruling dated nov 6 san diego superior court judge joel r wohlfeil wrote that the state couldn’t stop clubs from “being allowed to provide live adult entertainment” in san diego county saying that the “harm to plaintiffs if the application is denied is greater than the harm to defendants if the application is granted” a week later according to the los angeles daily news los angeles superior court judge mitchell l beckloff ruled that pretrial discovery could go forward and witnesses could be called in the case against john macarthur’s church which has met for inperson services and been slapped with a contempt charge macarthur has gone to court as well although courts there have issued an injunction against his flock meeting macarthur’s establishment is known as grace community church the suit in san diego county was brought by two establishments pacers showgirls international and cheetahs gentlemen’s club i know the ruling you get on any constitutional issue can vary extensively depending on what judge you go before however let me note that one of the first things you’ll when you go to grace community church’s webpage is a reminder about adoption awareness month trending melania trump unveils spectacular patriotic white house christmas decorations the first thing you see when you go to cheetahs gentlemen’s club’s webpage — aside from a mountain of airbrushed human flesh — is a video featuring a helmetless maskless woman on rollerblades being pulled behind a golf cart full packed with maskfree people “this is what we do for quarantine at cheetahs” the caption beside the video reads it must be noted they showed enough restraint to keep their clothes on at present it seems the courts think cheetahs can apparently socially distance more effectively than grace community church if only john macarthur had rollerbladesurfed behind a golf cart well godspeak calvary chapel pastor rob mccoy figured that if you can’t beat ’em join ’em while his flock isn’t in san diego county — they’re up in los angelesadjacent ventura county — the ruling in san diego could theoretically be

they’ve also faced a filing of contempt however during last sunday’s sermon he said he found inspiration in how to beat the injunction from former arkansas gov mike huckabee huckabee in a fox news clip that mccoy played before the sermon said “i don’t have a lot of experience with the strip clubs i do have quite a bit of experience with churches “generally they’re a fairly safe place and i would think it’s ridiculous to say that people are safer in a strip club than they are at church” huckabee said that churches should simply “announce their pastor will remove his tie during the sermon and therefore he will take off an article of clothing making it a temporary strip club so that people will be able to go to church” related twitter wont factcheck chinese officials fake photo of australian solider beheading child mccoy did him one better engaging in a clean version of a strip tease before taking off the tie congregants meanwhile held up 1 bills crass perhaps not nearly as much as cheetahs gentlemen’s club — and while we christians are called not to descend to their level we can — and should — also mock the absurdities of the secular world as well yes the lower courts act in a patchwork manner and it’s difficult to make a 11 comparison unless the same judge issued different rulings when it came to grace community church and cheetahs gentlemen’s club if california’s religious congregations can venueshop one hopes that someone has figured out a way to engineer it so their suit against the state ends up in front of judge wohlfeil — because from a purely utilitarian perspective churches mosques and synagogues represent the ultimate situation where the “harm to plaintiffs if the application is denied is greater than the harm to defendants if the application is granted” at the very least it represents the same issue at heart the first amendment in full “congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances” the freedom of speech and the prohibition against the prohibiting the free exercise of religion are coequal according to fox news the harvest rock church in california has petitioned the supreme court for an emergency injunction against the state’s coronavirus laws which currently prohibit inperson services for counties in the most restrictive “purple tier” at present 94 percent of the state’s population lives in “purple tier” counties their petition isn’t tied to strip clubs but instead to the stringent guidelines religious congregations have operated under since covid19 restrictions were first issued meanwhile liquor stores and cannabis dispensaries inter alia have been allowed to keep their doors open “for over nine months the governor has continued to discriminate against churches’ religious worship services while permitting myriad nonreligious entities to continue to gather without numerical restrictions inside the same house of worship and in other external comparable congregate assemblies” harvest rock church argued in its filing for good measure the filing also referenced california gov gavin newsom’s field trip to a napa valley restaurant and said he had been “publicly encouraging and supporting mass protestors rioters and looters to gather without numerical restriction in blatant disregard for his own orders” this is probably a more sound legal basis to go on if one wishes to thumb one’s nose at the state of california particularly given the supreme court’s 54 decision wednesday to strike down new york gov andrew cuomo’s restrictions on religious congregations however if you want to make an absolute mockery of where the golden state is in 2020 a pastor’s necktie strip tease will do nicely mccoy’s sermon by the way dealt with persecution of the church under covid19 it’s worth listening to lawmakers in sacramento weren’t going to they’ll notice this however we are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism read our editorial standards

trust mainstream news to do their job” the alleged kidnapping scheme aimed at whitmer included plans to overthrow several state governments that the suspects “believe are violating the us constitution” immediately corporate media blamed “white supremacists” and president donald trump “if the president read his intel briefings and understood the dogma of white nationalist groups” wrote politico’s chief political correspondent tim alberta “he’d realize that language like ‘liberate michigan’ is read as tacit permission — if not explicit encouragement — for militias to take action” in an interview with npr michigan attorney general dana nessel said multiple white supremacists and antigovernment groups in the plot acted “in concert based on a shared extreme ideology” nessel said she believes racist militia groups across the country are taking advantage of covid19 and black lives matter unrest “they’re using it to recruit and to formulate plots” she stated “i think that those protests of covid lockdowns were used actually as recruiting stations to add more members and to find people that were angry with the governor angry with the government and frankly i think encouraged by the words of our president” nessel continued whitmer also tied trump’s rhetoric to the plot saying on television she “wakes up every day with such hatred in her heart” for trump the governor alleged “the president of the united states stood before the american people and refused to condemn white supremacist and hate groups like these two michigan militia groups” that is false trump has repeatedly publicly disavowed white supremacy and racism whitmer also said the “president’s words” during the debate were a “rallying cry” and “call to action” for “hate groups” “when our leaders meet with encourage or fraternize with domestic terrorists they legitimize their actions and they are complicit” whitmer said turns out at least one of the men involved in the thwarted kidnapping plot is not a white supremacist at all nor was he inspired by trump “democrats and the media say president realdonaldtrump inspired these idiots who plotted to kidnap gov gretchen whitmer” wrote starbuck on twitter “they’re lying as this key member of the plot makes very clear he hated trump too they’re government and police hating anarchists don’t fall for the lies” democrats and the media haven’t only been disingenuous about this story they have a history of not accurately representing whitmer or her michigan constituents alberta made another wild claim in an april politico story he wrote that in lansing “you cannot find anyone republican or democrat on the record or off who does not admire the skills of the state’s 49th governor” “moreover just about everyone likes her” he said “she is genuine secure quick to give a hug or share a dirty joke” this storyline is incredibly ridiculous considering a massive effort to recall whitmer has been underway for months now eleven approved recall petitions are currently in circulation whitmer was also rebuked by the michigan supreme court for violating the law in her abuse of emergency powers president trump wrote on twitter thursday “governor whitmer of michigan has done a terrible job she locked down her state for everyone except her husband’s boating activities the federal government provided tremendous help to the great people of

sterling memorial library at yale university sterling memorial library at yale university photo ed stannard hearst connecticut media photo ed stannard hearst connecticut media image 1 of 5 caption close justice department finds yale biased against asian white applicants 1 5 back to gallery new haven — the department of justice thursday notified yale university that it has found the university illegally discriminates against asianamerican and white applicants in its undergraduate admissions process the twoyear investigation focused on title vi of the 1964 civil rights act after a complaint was made by asianamerican groups at yale according to a press release “there is no such thing as a nice form of race discrimination” said assistant attorney general eric dreiband for the civil rights division “unlawfully dividing americans into racial and ethnic blocs fosters stereotypes bitterness and division it is past time for american institutions to recognize that all people should be treated with decency and respect and without unlawful regard to the color of their skin” dreiband said in a statement “in 1890 frederick douglass explained that the ‘business of government is to hold its broad shield over all and to see that every american citizen is alike and equally protected in his civil and personal rights’ the department of justice agrees and will continue to fight for the civil rights of all people throughout our nation” thursday night yale president peter salovey issued a statement titled “yale’s steadfast commitment to diversity” “the department’s allegation is baseless” salovey said despite producing “large quantities of documents and data the doj concluded its investigation before reviewing and receiving all the information it has requested” he wrote “i am dismayed that the doj inexplicably rushed to conclude its investigation without conducting a fully informed analysis which would have shown that yale’s practices absolutely comply with decades of supreme court precedent” salovey wrote he said yale “will not change its admissions processes in response to today’s letter because the doj is seeking to impose a standard that is inconsistent with existing law” salovey concluded “by bringing people of different backgrounds talents and perspectives together we best prepare our students for a complex and dynamic world yale’s admissions practices help us realize our mission to improve the world today and for future generations at this unique moment in our history when so much attention properly is being paid to issues of race yale will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence” scot x esdaile president of the connecticut chapter of the naacp said “this looks like a rightwing reaction from the department of justice attacking special measures that were being made to make classrooms equitable on yale’s and harvard’s campuses” in october 2019 a federal judge rejected a lawsuit against harvard university brought by students for fair admissions a group of asian americans who had been rejected by harvard the group claimed harvard favored other people of color over asian americans in its admissions policies the justice department filed a brief supporting the plaintiffs in that suit us district judge allison burroughs wrote that the university could consider race as a factor in order to achieve a diverse student body “the rich diversity at harvard and other colleges and universities and the benefits that flow from that diversity will foster the tolerance acceptance and understanding that will ultimately make race conscious admissions obsolete” she wrote students for fair admissions has appealed the decision to the 1st circuit us court of appeals edward blum president of nonprofit students for fair admissions said in an email thursday “we applaud the justice department’s extensive investigation into yale’s racially discriminatory admissions policies” “the justice department’s findings of decadesold purposeful racial discrimination in admissions is not surprising since all of the ivy league and other competitive universities admit to using racial classifications and preferences in their admissions policies this investigation reinforces the need for all universities to end racebased admissions policies” “our nation’s civil rights laws and constitution must be interpreted to forbid the use of race and ethnicity in college admissions” blum said “in our multiracial and multiethnic nation the admissions’ bar cannot be raised for some races and ethnicities and lowered for others” letter to attorney spivack yale 8132020 0 1 by helen bennett on scribd the department of justice found yale discriminates based on race and national origin in its undergraduate admissions process and that race is the determinative factor in hundreds of admission decisions each year for the great majority of applicants asian americans and whites have only onetenth to onefourth of the likelihood of admission as africanamerican applicants with comparable academic credentials according to the release yale rejects scores of asianamerican and white applicants each year based on their race whom it otherwise would admit according to the justice department although the supreme court has held that colleges receiving federal funds may consider applicants’ race the department of justice found yale’s use of race is not sufficiently limited yale uses race at multiple steps of its admissions process resulting in a multiplied effect of race on an applicant’s likelihood of admission and yale racially balances its classes the department says the department of justice has demanded yale agree not to use race or national origin in its upcoming 202021 undergraduate admissions cycle and if yale proposes to consider race or national origin in future admissions cycles it must first submit to the department of justice a plan demonstrating its proposal is narrowly tailored as required by law including by identifying a date for the end of race discrimination “we would like to secure yale’s compliance with title vi by voluntary means” dreiband wrote to that end yale must agree not to use race or national origin in its upcoming 20202021 undergraduate admissions cycle and if yale proposes to consider race or national origin in future admissions cycles it must first submit to the department of justice a plan demonstrating that its proposal is narrowly tailored as required by law any such proposal should include an end date to yale’s use of race” the justice department said if yale refuses to comply it will file a lawsuit against the university to force yale to abide by title vi because yale receives millions of dollars in taxpayer funds it must comply with title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 a cornerstone civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race color or national origin in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance the justice department launched its investigation of yale’s admission policies in april 2018 in friday’s letter to attorney peter spivack of washington dc dreiband wrote “yale grants substantial and often determinative preferences based on race to certain raciallyfavored applicants and relatively and significantly disfavors other applicants because of their race yale’s race discrimination imposes undue and unlawful penalties on raciallydisfavored applicants including in particular asian american and white applicants” dreiband said “the likelihood of admission for asian american and white applicants who have similar academic credentials is significantly lower than for african american and hispanic applicants to yale college” with asian american and white applicants having “onetenth to onefourth of the likelihood of admission as african american applicants with comparable academic credentials” he said “it appears yale’s diversity goals are not sufficiently measurable not narrowly tailored” and that the university “uses race at multiple points in its admissions process” “yale’s race discrimination dates back more than four decades to at least the 1970s and yale’s race discrimination contains no time limits” dreiband wrote “instead it appears that yale intends to continue discriminating on the basis of race apparently in perpetuity indeed yale admits that it intends to continue its racebased admissions process for the ‘foreseeable future’” “the totality of the information produced by yale demonstrates that yale’s multidecade use of race continues unabated without any serious effort by yale to consider an admissions process that is free of race discrimination” the justice department

on tuesday afternoon that he has banned the us government from doing business with people and companies who promote farleft critical race theory noting that the ideology is “divisive and harmful” “a few weeks ago i banned efforts to indoctrinate government employees with divisive and harmful sex and racebased ideologies” trump tweeted “today i’ve expanded that ban to people and companies that do business with our country the united states military government contractors and grantees americans should be taught to take pride in our great country and if you don’t there’s nothing in it for you” …with our country the united states military government contractors and grantees americans should be taught to take pride in our great country and if you don’t there’s nothing in it for you below is the full text of trump’s executive order on combating race and sex stereotyping by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america including the federal property and administrative services act 40 usc 101 et seq and in order to promote economy and efficiency in federal contracting to promote unity in the federal workforce and to combat offensive and antiamerican race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating it is hereby ordered as follows section 1 purpose from the battlefield of gettysburg to the bus boycott in montgomery and the selmatomontgomery marches heroic americans have valiantly risked their lives to ensure that their children would grow up in a nation living out its creed expressed in the declaration of independence “we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal” it was this belief in the inherent equality of every individual that inspired the founding generation to risk their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to establish a new nation unique among the countries of the world president abraham lincoln understood that this belief is “the electric cord” that “links the hearts of patriotic and libertyloving” people no matter their race or country of origin it is the belief that inspired the heroic black soldiers of the 54th massachusetts infantry regiment to defend that same union at great cost in the civil war and it is what inspired dr martin luther king jr to dream that his children would one day “not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character” thanks to the courage and sacrifice of our forebears america has made significant progress toward realization of our national creed particularly in the 57 years since dr king shared his dream with the country today however many people are pushing a different vision of america that is grounded in hierarchies based on collective social and political identities rather than in the inherent and equal dignity of every person as an individual this ideology is rooted in the pernicious and false belief that america is an irredeemably racist and sexist country that some people simply on account of their race or sex are oppressors and that racial and sexual identities are more important than our common status as human beings and americans this destructive ideology is grounded in misrepresentations of our country’s history and its role in the world although presented as new and revolutionary they resurrect the discredited notions of the nineteenth century’s apologists for slavery who like president lincoln’s rival stephen a douglas maintained that our government “was made on the white basis” “by white men for the benefit of white men” our founding documents rejected these racialized views of america which were soundly defeated on the bloodstained battlefields of the civil war yet they are now being repackaged and sold as cuttingedge insights they are designed to divide us and to prevent us from uniting as one people in pursuit of one common destiny for our great country unfortunately this malign ideology is now migrating from the fringes of american society and threatens to infect core institutions of our country instructors and materials teaching that men and members of certain races as well as our most venerable institutions are inherently sexist and racist are appearing in workplace diversity trainings across the country even in components of the federal government and among federal contractors for example the department of the treasury recently held a seminar that promoted arguments that “virtually all white people regardless of how ‘woke’ they are contribute to racism” and that instructed small group leaders to encourage employees to avoid “narratives” that americans should “be more colorblind” or “let people’s skills and personalities be what differentiates them” training materials from argonne national laboratories a federal entity stated that racism “is interwoven into every fabric of america” and described statements like “color blindness” and the “meritocracy” as “actions of bias” materials from sandia national laboratories also a federal entity for nonminority males stated that an emphasis on “rationality over emotionality” was a characteristic of “white males” and asked those present to “acknowledge” their “privilege” to each other a smithsonian institution museum graphic recently claimed that concepts like “objective rational linear thinking” “hard work” being “the key to success” the “nuclear family” and belief in a single god are not values that unite americans of all races but are instead “aspects and assumptions of whiteness” the museum also stated that “facing your whiteness is hard and can result in feelings of guilt sadness confusion defensiveness or fear” all of this is contrary to the fundamental premises underpinning our republic that all individuals are created equal and should be allowed an equal opportunity under the law to pursue happiness and prosper based on individual merit executive departments and agencies agencies our uniformed services federal contractors and federal grant recipients should of course continue to foster environments devoid of hostility grounded in race sex and other federally protected characteristics training employees to create an inclusive workplace is appropriate and beneficial the federal government is and must always be committed to the fair and equal treatment of all individuals before the law but training like that discussed above perpetuates racial stereotypes and division and can use subtle coercive pressure to ensure conformity of viewpoint such ideas may be fashionable in the academy but they have no place in programs and activities supported by federal taxpayer dollars research also suggests that blamefocused diversity training reinforces biases and decreases opportunities for minorities our federal civil service system is based on merit principles these principles codified at 5 usc 2301 call for all employees to “receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to” race or sex “and with proper regard for their constitutional rights” instructing federal employees that treating individuals on the basis of individual merit is racist or sexist directly undermines our merit system principles and impairs the efficiency of the federal service similarly our uniformed services should not teach our heroic men and women in uniform the lie that the country for which they are willing to die is fundamentally racist such teachings could directly threaten the cohesion and effectiveness of our uniformed services such activities also promote division and inefficiency when carried out by federal contractors the federal government has long prohibited federal contractors from engaging in race or sex discrimination and required contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that such discrimination does not occur the participation of contractors’ employees in training that promotes race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating similarly undermines efficiency in federal contracting such requirements promote divisiveness in the workplace and distract from the pursuit of excellence and collaborative achievements in public administration therefore it shall be the policy of the united states not to promote race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating in the federal workforce or in the uniformed services and not to allow grant funds to be used for these purposes in addition federal contractors will not be permitted to inculcate such views in their employees sec 2 definitions for the purposes of this order the phrase a “divisive concepts” means the concepts

ruled friday aug 14 2020 that the law banning magazines holding more than 10 bullets violates the constitutional right to bear firearms ap photorich pedroncelli file file in this june 27 2017 file photo a semiautomatic rifle is displayed with a 25 shot magazine left and a 10 shot magazine right at a gun store in elk grove calif a threejudge panel of the 9th us circuit court of appeals has thrown out californias ban on highcapacity ammunition magazines the panels majority ruled friday aug 14 2020 that the law banning magazines holding more than 10 bullets violates the constitutional right to bear firearms ap photorich pedroncelli file sacramento calif ap — a threejudge panel of the 9th us circuit court of appeals on friday threw out california’s ban on highcapacity ammunition magazines saying the law violates the us constitution’s protection of the right to bear firearms “even wellintentioned laws must pass constitutional muster” appellate judge kenneth lee wrote for the panel’s majority california’s ban on magazines holding more than 10 bullets “strikes at the core of the second amendment — the right to armed selfdefense” he noted that california passed the law “in the wake of heartwrenching and highly publicized mass shootings” but said that isn’t enough to justify a ban whose scope “is so sweeping that half of all magazines in america are now unlawful to own in california” advertisement california attorney general xavier becerra’s office said it is reviewing the decision and he “remains committed to using every tool possible to defend california’s gun safety laws and keep our communities safe” gun owners cannot immediately rush to buy highcapacity magazines because a stay issued by the lower court judge remains in place but becerra did not say if the state would seek a further delay of friday’s ruling to prevent an immediate buying spree if the lower court judge ends that restriction gun groups estimated that more than a million highcapacity ammunition magazines may have legally flooded into california during a oneweek window before the judge stayed his ruling three years ago becerra also did not say if he would ask a larger 11judge appellate panel to reconsider the ruling by the three judges or if he would appeal to the us supreme court gov gavin newsom who championed the magazine ban when he was lieutenant governor defended the law as a vital gun violence prevention measure “i think it was sound i think it was right and the overwhelming majority of californians agreed when they supported a ballot initiative that we put forth” he said friday california rifle pistol association attorney chuck michel called friday’s decision “a huge victory” for gun owners “and the right to choose to own a firearm to defend your family” while a group that favors firearms restrictions called it ”dangerous” and expects it will be overturned the ruling has national implications because other states have similar restrictions though it immediately applies only to western states under the appeals court’s jurisdiction gun rights groups have been trying to get such cases before the nation’s high court now that it has a more conservative majority the decision written by an appellate judge appointed by president donald trump “should put gun safety advocates across the country on high alert” said giffords law center litigation director hannah shearer “these judges are gaining potentially irreversible inroads on our appellate courts” however the supreme court’s majority in june declined to consider several challenges to federal and state gun control laws including massachusetts’ ban on largecapacity ammunition magazines aside from the magazine ban itself michel and the unaffiliated second amendment foundation said the case has legal implications for other gun restrictions should it reach the justices because it could allow the court to clarify an obscure legal debate over what standard of review should be used “the supreme court seems inclined to do away with the complicated subjective tests that many courts have wrongly applied in second amendment cases in favor of a clearer more objective ‘originalist’ approach that considers the text history and tradition of a law to determine what infringements might be tolerated” michel said in an email friday’s ruling was a fractured decision partly because of that issue two of the three judges voted to toss out the state’s ban while the third judge dissented us district court judge barbara lynn of texas who had been named the third judge on the appellate panel said the majority’s ruling conflicts with decisions in six other federal appellate courts across the nation and with a 2015 ruling by a different panel of the 9th circuit itself she said she would have upheld california’s law based on that precedent “this ruling is an extreme outlier” given those earlier decisions said eric tirschwell managing director for everytown law the litigation team affiliated with everytown for gun safety that favors firearms restrictions he said he expects a larger 9th circuit panel to “correct this erroneous dangerous and outofstep decision” opponents argued unsuccessfully that larger capacity magazines are not needed for selfprotection “the second amendment does not empower private citizens to arm themselves with weapons of war” said jonathan lowy of the brady campaign to prevent gun violence friday’s decision upholds a 2017 ruling by san diegobased us district judge roger benitez who blocked a new law that would have barred gun owners from possessing magazines holding more than 10 bullets but he and the appeals court went further by declaring unconstitutional a state law that had prohibited buying or selling such magazines since 2000 that law had let those who had the magazines before then keep them but barred new sales or imports

the university of chicago crime lab the lab’s data doesn’t go back further than 1961 from 7 pm friday may 29 through 5 am monday june 1 25 people were killed in the city with another 85 wounded by gunfire according to data maintained by the chicago suntimes in a city with an international reputation for crime — where 900 murders per year were common in the early 1990s — it was the most violent weekend in chicago’s modern history stretching police resources that were already thin because of protests and looting “we’ve never seen anything like it at all” said max kapustin the senior research director at the crime lab “i don’t even know how to put it into context it’s beyond anything that we’ve ever seen before” the next highest murder total for a single day was on aug 4 1991 when 13

“open season” last weekend in his neighborhood and others on the south and west sides “on saturday and particularly sunday i heard people saying all over ‘hey there’s no police anywhere police ain’t doing nothing’” pfleger said “i sat and watched a store looted for over an hour” he added “no police came i got in my car and drove around to some other places getting looted and didn’t see police anywhere” mayor lori lightfoot said on may 31 alone chicago’s 911 emergency center received 65000 calls for all types of service — 50000 more than on a usual day pfleger said the systemic problems that have plagued minority communities for decades — like joblessness food insecurity and a lack of housing — already were heightened by the covid19 outbreak which he said “made a bad situation worse” floyd’s killing in minnesota simply brought further to the fore the “hopelessness and anger” felt by those living in blighted communities added pfleger who said the current unrest reminds him of the rioting that broke out when the rev martin luther king jr was assassinated “it’s like a time bomb out here” pfleger said “people are on the edge people are angry people are poor and they don’t even know when it’s going to change” if immediate action isn’t taken to address systemic racism poverty and “black folks being shot down and killed out here like dogs” pfleger said the last weekend in may will merely serve as a “coming attraction of what’s going to happen next” most homicide victims in chicago are young black men and the suspects are too but murders have fallen significantly in recent years along with policeinvolved shootings there were 764 murders and 12 fatal policeinvolved shootings in 2016 compared with 492 murders and three fatal policeinvolved shootings last year “the level of activity experienced over the last week has been unprecedented and the department is actively investigating multiple incidents across the city and working to determine the motives in these cases” chicago police spokesman thomas ahern said in a statement “ the department is actively working to seek justice for all the residents impacted especially those who have been killed or injured by these senseless acts of violence” ahern said after “increased violent and criminal activity” on saturday may 30 police canceled days off for all officers and placed them on 12hour shifts in order to direct “our full force of manpower towards chicago’s neighborhoods particularly on the south and west sides” ‘positive influence’ slain the weekend’s death toll includes 21yearold gregory lewis one of six people killed may 30 lewis was gunned down early that morning while riding in a vehicle in the 500 block of east 115th street mustafa abdullah lewis’ former dean at excel academy of roseland spoke glowingly of his former student who he described as a “positive influence” and a leader who for a time served as the vice president of the school’s student government “he was very helpful at deescalating any situations that had potential to kind of escalate into anything further” abdullah said “he was a really good kid” abdullah said he had a “unique” relationship with lewis in addition to joking around and “busting on each other” lewis also helped abdullah acclimate to life in chicago as he was still adjusting after moving from philadelphia “we would sit and talk in my office for hours just about life” he said “so just kind of schooling me on the ins and outs of chicago the do’s and don’ts just kind of what the young people are going through today as far as neighborhood situations or whatever the case may be” in recent years abdullah fell out of touch with lewis but said he knew his former student was trying to launch a rap career on thursday abdullah fondly recalled a school trip to washington dc that he and lewis went on together the pair spent the bus ride down poking fun at each other which served as a constant source of entertainment for the other students along for the ride once in the capitol the group toured the historical sites and museums and took in a washington wizards game “i could tell that he was very humbled and very appreciative of the experience of getting the chance to get out of chicago for a few days and then kind of proverbially and actually just letting his hair down and be able to just be a kid” he said shot after her own graduation party for teyonna lofton of gresham last sunday started on a high note the 18yearold recently finished her senior year at perspectives leadership academy and her family was holding a socially distanced graduation parade to honor the occasion while the day “started off perfect” a trip to a gas station at the corner of 81st and racine — a halfmile south of st sabina — later that day quickly turned into the most harrowing experience of her young life as she waited in line outside the store an suv pulled up and someone inside opened fire into the crowd striking lofton and two others struck near her elbow she tried repeatedly to call 911 for help “when i needed help to call the police and stuff nobody responded nobody answered” lofton said “my mom had to come from home and we had to get to the hospital” on the way to little company of mary hospital in evergreen park lofton peered out her mother’s car window and saw the “madness” that was unfolding outside “it was just people jumping out their cars into stores and stealing and looting police was letting them do whatever they wanted” she said “they did not care” lofton added “nobody cared” because the bullet struck an artery lofton was ultimately transferred to the trauma unit at christ medical center in oak lawn for surgery after being released wednesday she now faces months of physical therapy after losing feeling in much of her wounded arm lofton was among the 48 people wounded in shootings across chicago that day though she has worked with pfleger in the past to advocate against gun violence lofton said she plans to increase her efforts now that she’s become a victim “i want to really make some noise” she said late last week lofton was concerned that detectives still hadn’t reached out to her about the shooting which hasn’t been publicly reported by the department police attention diverted expert kapustin of u of c’s crime lab said massive upheavals or protests typically require police departments to divert officers to respond to demonstrations “when cpd has to turn its attention elsewhere and there’s suddenly this vacuum that opens up you also unfortunately see a picture like you saw with last weekend where you see an absurd amount of carnage people getting injured and killed” he said “those forces are still there” kapustin said the current situation “lays bare a really nuanced understanding of the role of the police” “you have to sort of ask yourself how are you going to get to a place where you have a police department that people respect and that has earned the trust of the community but it’s still actually effective at reducing gun violence which is the thing that plagues a lot of these neighborhoods” kapustin said “and we’re so far right now from getting that figured out” ‘great great deal of anxiety’ andrew holmes and pastor donovan price have seen more anguish than most both men respond to crime scenes across the city offering support and comfort to the families of those killed even for them the last weekend in may was different “i’ve been experiencing a great great great great great deal of anxiety” price said “i’ve been hurting i’ve been paining i’ve been crying i’ve been losing sleep for the city because i love the city and so i’ve been hurting for that as well as watching it to a certain level not selfdestruct but definitely take a sip of the poison every now and then” difficulty viewing this map click here in price’s view collaboration between academics clergy and neighborhood leaders has been lacking in the fight to tamp down violence “there’s a difference between swelling and growth and the amount of programs and nonprofits and town halls and all of those things caused a swelling — mainly of the peoples’ heads who were doing them — in thinking that they’ve got this they’ve solved this we’ve got a handle on this” price said lea este artículo en español en la voz chicago un servicio presentado por aarp chicago even aside from his work in aiding bereaved families holmes knows violence all too well his daughter was shot to death in indianapolis in 2015 two years later a young cousin of his — an 11yearold girl — was shot and killed in parkway gardens on the south side in the last week holmes said he’s felt “kind of numb” and can sometimes struggle to find words of comfort for grieving families “because sometimes when they lose their baby there’s not a right word that you can say especially to a mother a woman” holmes said “it took her nine months to give birth and life to that baby and it takes a second for a person to discharge that weapon and take that person’s life and that’s wrong that’s a lot of pain” “i’m not going to sit here and tell you i’m all right” he added “no i’m not all right because i feel that pain i feel that suffering that they’re going through” killed while visiting angelo bronson was standing in englewood’s 6800 block of south laflin on may 31 when someone fired

two people initially taken into custody have been released without charges “john had a big heart he was there for us and his death has taken so much from us” his aunt marie marsham said “when you needed something done he was the first to be there to help you out” 2 students among the victims other may 31 victims included two 18yearold women — both students lazarra daniels a student at drw college prep in lawndale was found shot by officers at 1051 pm sunday in the 4200 block of west van buren street principal tony sutton called daniels’ death “an incalculable loss for her family and

gifted young lady who will be truly missed” a resident adviser at lincoln hall dorm wrote police said bolden was killed sunday afternoon when she was shot during an argument in englewood where she

painstaking recount early results on thursday showed latinas for trump cofounder ileana garcia leading democratic incumbent josé javier rodríguez in the race for senate district 37 by a mere 34 votes in a video posted shortly after the recount was done rodríguez conceded and called for an investigation into the race raising concerns about the influence of a thirdparty candidate backed by dark money who received more than 6300 votes in an election decided by a few dozen out of more than 215000 “democracy requires transparency” he said in the video “in order to achieve that i believe this election requires a full investigation so that those who may have violated the law are held to account and so that such tactics are not used in future elections” rodríguez’s loss is a stunning blow to senate democrats who went into the election cycle hoping to flip three seats to reach parity in the chamber and ended up losing one seat a balance that will make it tougher for them to influence the gop’s legislative agenda in the near future democrats say the loss is an indictment of florida’s weak campaign finance laws that allow a shadow candidate and half a million dollars in dark money to infiltrate the race siphoning votes all while technically following the rules “our election laws are just not strong enough” incoming senate minority leader gary farmer said thursday republicans however said rodríguez’s loss should be added to the “litany of introspection florida democrats need to explore in the coming months” in the wake of stinging defeats this november including the loss of five seats in the florida house the results will be certified by secretary of state laurel lee on friday which is the deadline for military and overseas ballots to be counted a legislative tugofwar in 2016 rodríguez unseated threeterm republican sen miguel díaz de la portilla a member of miamidade’s powerful cubanamerican political family with a threepoint advantage his victory in the redrawn seat was made possible in large part to the heavy backing from the party and wealthy donors and president donald trump’s poor showing in miamidade county at the time senate republican leaders blamed díaz de la portilla’s defeat on the unpopularity of trump in the county which he lost to democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton by about 30 percentage points trump is once again linked to the outcome of the race but for the exact opposite reasons democratic presidential nominee joe biden’s poor showing in miamidade allowed trump to cut into his 2016 margin by more than 20 points biden’s lackluster performance let trump make gains in senate district 37 and opened the door for garcia’s victory in the hispanicmajority district protecting rodríguez’s seat was always a top priority for senate democrats who wanted to improve their chances of gaining ground in tallahassee the florida republican senatorial campaign committee the campaign arm of republican senators ended up outworking senate democrats it ramped up efforts ahead of the election and spent 137260 in october on polling consulting research staff and phone banking to help garcia’s candidacy according to campaign finance records at the same time the district swung 92 percent in trump’s favor with the support of cuban americans and noncuban hispanics biden still defeated trump in the district but by a much smaller margin than clinton did noparty candidate is a factor much mystery remains around the network of unknown candidates with no party affiliation npa who ran in three competitive senate districts most notably in senate district 37 where the thirdparty candidate netted more than 6300 votes and likely influenced the outcome voters in senate districts 9 37 and 39 were targeted by similarlooking political mail ads funded by a mystery donor that aimed to confuse voters in an apparent effort to shave votes from democratic candidates the mailers included messaging on issues that historically appeal to democrats and advertised the littleknown candidates who did not actively campaign the ads urged voters to “cut the strings” from partybacked candidates and to vote for thirdparty candidates in senate district 37 alex rodriguez who shares a surname with the democrat incumbent was promoted in dark money mailers as a candidate who would “fight climate change” “hold the police accountable” and “guarantee a living wage” he received about 3 percent of the vote thirdparty or writein candidates ran in eight of the 20 state senate races on average those candidates got about 2 percent of the vote making the vote count toward alex rodriguez well above average both rodríguez and celso alfonso the noparty candidate who ran in district 39 were registered republicans when they voted in the 2018 midterm elections both qualified as candidates the same day with checks handdelivered in tallahassee and timestamped within minutes of one another both candidates email addresses are gmail accounts with identical patterns first initial last name district number and “2020” they also have identical campaign finance records both only reporting 2000 loans to themselves and used the money to pay for the 118788 filing fee required of noparty candidates for state senate a wplg local 10 report found that alex rodriguez did not live at the address he listed in his campaign filings the miamidade state attorney’s office which prosecuted exlawmaker daisy baez for lying about her place of residency on her voter registration affidavit said they were aware of the report however they could neither confirm nor deny the existence of an ongoing investigation citing agency policy rodríguez has blamed senate republican leaders for planting the thirdparty candidate in the race saying “tallahassee republicans ran one unethical campaign with two candidates” referring to garcia and alex rodriguez erin isaac a spokeswoman for the florida republican senatorial campaign committee and incoming senate president wilton simpson specifically said that the committee and simpson were not involved in alex rodriguez’s campaign candidacy or mailers much mystery remains about the donor who paid for the mailers the donor proclivity had never made political contributions in florida until early october and has no paper trail according to business and tax records reviewed by the timesherald the donor poured 550000 into two new political committees — our florida pc and the truth pc — which quickly used the money to buy what is believed to be hundreds of thousands of mailed political advertisements in support of the noparty candidates the committees only registered agents are sierra olive and hailey defilippis two young women with no known political experience both women are from the tampa bay area olive from palm harbor and defilippis from dunedin olive 24 and defilippis 25 both registered republicans have failed to report campaign contributions and expenditures for the political committees as required by state law and could face fines according to a letter sent by the florida division of elections on oct 29 these letters serve as further indication that the committees were not actively engaged in campaign activity other than to buy the mailers in early october the 550000 spent by the committees flowed to a company called advance impression llc which was created in 2018 and is operated out of a private residence in clermont according to state business records the company has no working phone and it had never been paid to do political mailers by a candidate or political committee in florida until the truth pc and our florida pc popped up and made the payments according to campaign finance records additionally the truth pc listed its address as the address for the printing company in expenditure records for the mailers it is unclear why the committee and the company share the same address neither would respond to requests for comment a search of both olive and defilippis names and home addresses in campaign finance records showed no links to other campaign expenditures or contributions this election cycle attempts to reach both women by social media email and phone calls have been unsuccessful the candidates ileana garcia was relatively unknown in political circles until 2016 when she founded latinas for trump to counter antagonism against hispanic supporters of president trump before then she was a television personality and selfdescribed sandra bullock doppelgänger shortly after latinas for trump got off the ground the trump campaign hired her as trump’s communication director to do latino outreach garcia then went on to work as deputy press secretary for the department of homeland security under the trump administration ileana garcia founder of latinas for trump conducts a tv interview in coral gables in 2016 alex daugherty mcclatchydccom according to her website garcia who is cubanamerican was raised in allapattah and is a single mother of one her twitter was recently wiped and her facebook deleted over the weekend before her facebook was deleted she prematurely changed the page’s name to “senator ileana garcia” in august 2019 garcia joined parler a social media site that touts “free expression without violence and no censorship” and displays posts that contain farright content antisemitism and conspiracy theories her account is private garcia 50 never granted an interview to the miami herald before or after the election erin issac a spokeswoman for senate republican campaigns stonewalled all attempts to reach her and provided statements on her behalf that broadly addressed the issues she would prioritize if elected according to one statement garcia has a few broad legislative priorities those include the following working with democrats to “help end covid” fix the state’s unemployment system improve the economy increase funding for miamidade’s public school and school choice options and “work to make healthcare truly affordable by expanding access to quality healthcare” the statement added that she wanted to defeat rodriguez because he had a “farleft agenda” which she broadly characterized as one that would “expand the role of government increase taxes and deny parents the opportunity to decide the best education for their children” while in the legislature rodríguez pushed climate change legislation and often filed bills to protect tenants in foreclosure and reform condo law the league of conservation voters an environmental advocacy group that worked with rodríguez on legislation and reliably backed his campaigns called the loss “devastating” rodríguez campaigned on promises to keep pushing for measures that address climate change including how it impacts infrastructure and public health in the region it was supposed to be a continuation of what he had been preaching since he was elected four years ago rodríguez did not only talk about it — he wore it for three legislative sessions in a row he wore rubber boots with the slogan actonclimatefl to raise awareness about the threats climate change pose to the state during this year’s legislative session rodríguez achieved part of that slogan along with state rep vance aloupis rmiami rodríguez championed legislation that explicitly acknowledges climate change’s threats to the state and requires statefinanced projects on the coast to take sea level rise into account before starting to build a structure desantis signed the bill into law in june and it went into effect july 1 “not many people in the whole state understand climate change issues like senator rodríguez” said jonathan webber the deputy director of the league of conservation voters “those are going to be some big

crammed into childsized desks and dug through their pockets and purses for pens as ann lee launches a powerpoint presentation her primer on college admissions begins with the basics application deadlines the relative virtues of the sat versus the act and how many advanced placement tests to take then she eases into a potentially incendiary topic — one that many counselors like her have learned they cannot avoid “let’s talk about asians” she says advertisement lee’s next slide shows three columns of numbers from a princeton university study that tried to measure how race and ethnicity affect admissions by using sat scores as a benchmark it uses the term “bonus” to describe how many extra sat points an applicant’s race is worth she points to the first column african americans received a “bonus” of 230 points lee says she points to the second column “hispanics received a bonus of 185 points” advertisement the last column draws gasps asian americans lee says are penalized by 50 points — in other words they had to do that much better to win admission “do asians need higher test scores is it harder for asians to get into college the answer is yes” lee says “zenme keyi” one mother hisses in chinese how can this be possible advertisement college admission season ignites deep anxieties for asian american families who spend more than any other demographic on education at elite universities across the us asian americans form a larger share of the student body than they do of the population as a whole and increasingly they have turned against affirmative action policies that could alter those ratios and accuse admissions committees of discriminating against asian american applicants that perspective has pitted them against advocates for diversity more college berths for asian american students mean fewer for black and latino students who are statistically underrepresented at top universities but in the san gabriel valley’s hypercompetitive ethnic asian communities arguments for diversity can sometimes fall on deaf ears for immigrant parents raised in asia’s allornothing test cultures a good education is not just a measure of success — it’s a matter of survival they see academic achievement as a moral virtue and families organize their lives around their child’s education moving to the best school districts and paying for tutoring and tennis lessons an acceptance letter from a prestigious college is often the only acceptable return on an investment that stretches over decades lee is the cofounder of hs2 academy a college prep business that assumes that racial bias is a fact of college admissions and counsels students accordingly at 10 centers across the state the academy’s counselors teach countermeasures to asian american applicants the goal lee says is to help prospective college students avoid coming off like another “cookiecutter asian” advertisement “everyone is in orchestra and plays piano” lee says “everyone plays tennis everyone wants to be a doctor and write about immigrating to america you can’t get in with these cliche applications” like a lot of students at arcadia high school yue liang plans to apply to university of california campuses and major in engineering — or if her mother wins that argument premed she excels at math takes multiple ap courses and volunteers as does nearly everyone she knows being of asian descent the junior says is “a disadvantage” the problem she says is in the numbers advertisement asian families flock to the san gabriel valley’s school districts because they have some of the highest academic performance index scores in the state but with hundreds of topperforming students at each high school focusing on a small set of elite institutions it’s easy to get lost in the crowd of the school’s 4000 students nearly 3000 are of asian descent and like yue are willing to do whatever it takes to gain entrance to a prestigious university they will study until they can’t remember how to have fun and stuff their schedules with extracurriculars but there’s an important part of their college applications that they can’t improve as easily as an sat score their ethnicity in the san gabriel valley where aspirationally named tutoring centers such as little harvard and ivy league cluster within walking distance of high schools many of them priced more cheaply than a babysitter it didn’t take long for some centers to respond to students’ and parents’ fears of being edged out of a top school because of some intangible missing quality helping asian american students many of whom lead similar lives requires the embrace of some stereotypes says crystal zell hs2’s assistant director of counseling they are good at math and bad at writing and aspire to be doctors engineers or bankers according to the cliches she works with her students to identify what’s unique about them — and most of the time that’s not their career ambitions or their ethnicity advertisement “everyone comes in wanting the same thing” zell said “but that’s because they don’t know about anything else” if a student wants to be an engineer she makes sure to show other options she sends affluent students to volunteer in poor neighborhoods branch out from tennis or chess club or taekwondo she tells them learn a language other than chinese avoid writing your essay about your parents’ journey to america instead of just handing students a violin or a piano and saying pick one zell says hs2 offers them a buffet of interests and hobbies encouraging students to pick something that excites them lawrence leonn 16 is grateful for the help he doesn’t think race or ethnicity should matter but he believes it will advertisement “i don’t want to be racist or anything” lawrence said “everyone works hard and struggles but there’s this feeling that it’s going to be harder for us” complaints about bias in college admissions have persisted since at least the 1920s when a harvard university president tried to cap the number of jewish students in november a group called students for fair admissions filed a suit against harvard university for admissions policies that allegedly discriminate against asian americans the group cited the 2004 princeton study and other sources that offer statistics about asian americans’ test performance at the university of texas at austin an affirmative action policy that allows admissions committees to consider the race of prospective applicants has been argued all the way to the supreme court the policies were upheld by a lower court but that court’s decision was voided by the supreme court another court upheld the policies and another appeal is pending advertisement those who defend “holistic” admissions policies insist that considering a broader range of variables ensures that all applicants are judged fairly and the princeton study lee refers to has been widely criticized by academics who argue that it relies too heavily on grades and test scores to draw conclusions about racial bias and that the data the study uses are too old to be relevant still anxiety over racial admissions rates is peaking as cashcrunched public universities increasingly favor highpaying outofstate and foreign students at the expense of local applicants of every ethnicity a 2014 bill that would have asked voters to consider restoring race as a factor in admissions to public california colleges and universities sparked multiple public protests and scathing editorials in chinese newspapers the bill senate constitutional amendment 5 was shelved last year lee says that she usually tries to at least mention arguments in favor of diversity at her free college seminars she mentions how the black student population at ucla has declined precipitously and how student bodies at elite universities probably shouldn’t be 100 of asian descent when she looks to see the response she sees mostly slowly shaking heads “it’s really hard for me to explain diversity to parents whose only goal is getting their son into harvard” lee says advertisement that same ethic causes parents and students to agonize over which box if any to check on the race and nationality section of the application one parent asked zell whether it would help to legally change the family name to something more westernsounding last

own a slave … a man he set free before the civil war and who was apparently given to him as a “gift” in the first place he was a “slave owner” in that he was gifted a slave hated the idea and freed

‘given’ julia four enslaved people when she was a child eliza dan julia and john there is no evidence he legally transferred ownership to julia but from her writings it is clear she considered them hers” the american civil war museum’s website states asking his father for a loan in 1854 here’s what he got according to the website “ulysses when you are ready to come north i will give you a start but so long as you make your home among a tribe of slaveowners i will do nothing’” meanwhile he wasn’t necessarily a cheerful slaveowner “the use of slaves on the farm…was a source of irritation and shame to grant jefferson sapington told me that he and grant used to work in the fields with the blacks” grant biographer hamlin garland wrote according to the museum website garland quoted a neighbor of grant “he said with glee ‘grant was helpless when it came to making slaves work’ and mrs boggs corroborated this ‘he was no hand to manage negroes’ she said ‘he couldn’t force them to do anything he wouldn’t whip them he was too gentle and good tempered and besides he was not a slavery man’” here’s what grant wrote to his slaveowning fatherinlaw after the attack on fort sumter according to the museum website “in all this i can see but the doom of slavery the north do not want nor will they want to interfere with the institution but they will refuse for all time to give it protection unless the south shall return soon to their allegiance” and to his father grant wrote “my inclination is to whip the rebellion into submission preserving all constitutional rights if it cannot be whipped any other way than through a war against slavery let it come to that legitimately if it is necessary that slavery should fall that the republic may continue its existence let slavery go” many on the left deride grant for writing in 1863 that he was not “what could be called antislavery” however in the same letter to a friend here’s what he wrote according to the museum’s website “i try to judge fairly and honestly and it became patent in my mind early in the rebellion that the north and south could never live at peace with each other except as one nation and that without slavery as anxious as i am to see peace established i would not therefore be willing to see any settlement until the question is forever settled” after the war grant was elected president in 1868 and was forced to fight the south’s former slave owners who rose again in the form of the ku klux klan caputo’s colleagues at politico took note of grant’s actions in a “this day in politics” piece published april 20 2019 grant had signed the law known as “the kkk act” 148 years earlier in 1871 “the third force act also known as the kkk or the civil rights act of 1871 empowered president ulysses s grant to use the armed forces to combat those who conspired to deny equal protection of the laws and if necessary to suspend habeas corpus to enforce the act grant signed the legislation on this day in 1871” politico noted “after the act’s passage the president for the first time had the power to suppress state disorders on his own initiative and suspend the right of habeas corpus grant did not hesitate to use this authority “shortly after congress approved the law nine counties in south carolina where kkk terrorism was rampant were placed under martial law and thousands of persons were arrested” there’s no reason for ulysses s grant the general who helped the north set the slaves free to have his memory treated like it was in san francisco however his statue was toppled by modern americans like they were iraqis freed of the monstrous saddam hussein it’s probably worth asking at this point what kind of nation we are — and how we view our forebears is cancel culture now so toxic that we’re pulling down statues of former presidents who helped end the confederacy and slavery grant was a towering figure in american history who helped restore the union free the slaves and was eulogized by abolitionist hero frederick douglass and he’s treated as if he were a communist figure like romania’s ceaușescu who cares it’s juneteenth so let’s commemorate the day by assailing the legacy of ulysses s grant grant wasn’t perfect nor is any historical figure being human but to say he did more good than bad in a historical sense is to understate the case dramatically what happened to his statue isn’t just ahistorical it lacks a complete understanding of history instead it just looks at a figure and asks if he owned a slave that’s apparently what we’re going to do from now on again

pratt was ridiculed over the weekend for allegedly radiating “homophobic white christian supremacist energy” among other leftwing attacks but all this isn’t the bootwearing celebrity’s first rodeo

to advance his america first agenda signing an executive order last week to increase the domestic production of critical minerals vital to the us economy and national security — potentially lessening reliance on foreign adversaries like communist china the president also declared a national emergency over the threat dependence on china and other hostile nations poses the executive order says in part i donald j trump president of the united states of america find that a strong america cannot be dependent on imports from foreign adversaries for the critical minerals that are increasingly necessary to maintain our economic and military strength in the 21st century because of the national importance of reliable access to critical minerals i signed executive order 13817 of december 20 2017 a federal strategy to ensure secure and reliable supplies of critical minerals which required the secretary of the interior to identify critical minerals and made it the policy of the federal government “to reduce the nation’s vulnerability to disruptions in the supply of critical minerals” these critical minerals are necessary inputs for the products our military national infrastructure and economy depend on the most our country needs critical minerals to make airplanes computers cell phones electricity generation and transmission systems and advanced electronics though these minerals are indispensable to our country we presently lack the capacity to produce them in processed form in the quantities we need the order noted that 31 of 35 critical minerals american producers need for annual consumption are imported it also noted that the united states has no domestic production of 14 of the critical minerals it needs leaving the country “completely dependent” on imports much of that dependence is directly linked to china “our dependence on one country the people’s republic of china for multiple critical minerals is particularly concerning the united states now imports 80 percent of its rare earth elements directly from china with portions of the remainder indirectly sourced from china through other countries” the order states “in the 1980s the united states produced more of these elements than any other country in the world but china used aggressive economic practices to strategically flood the global market for rare earth elements and displace its competitors” “since gaining this advantage china has exploited its position in the rare earth elements market by coercing industries that rely on these elements to locate their facilities intellectual property and technology in china” the order states the effort involves multiple federal agencies led by interior including the treasury the department of defense the department of commerce and the department of energy the order also will provide resources to encourage domestic critical mineral production in the form of grants and loans and reforms to the mining permitting system also will advance domestic production american stakeholders are reacting positively to the move “this executive order is an important step toward ensuring the us is free from price manipulation and other aggressive economic maneuvers particularly as perpetrated by china” pini althaus ceo of usa rare earth said in a statement provided to breitbart news “our processing facility in colorado is already up and running our magnet manufacturing plant should be online in less than 12 months and in early 2023 the round top mine in texas which hosts 16 of the 17 rare earth elements lithium and a significant concentration of elements on the us government’s critical minerals list will be fully operational” althaus told breitbart news that he is also encouraged by bipartisan legislation that has recently been introduced in congress sen ted cruz rtx introduced the onshoring rare earths act reps lance gooden rtx and vicente gonzalez dtx introduced the reclaiming american rare earths act both bills create tax incentives and grant programs to encourage investment in and development of usbased rare earth and critical mineral production including mining reclamation and recycling through processing and advanced materials production the coalition for a prosperous america issued a statement on trump’s executive order “we congratulate the president and his team for this longoverdue step to save us mining” dan dimicco chairman of the coalition said “over the past two decades the united states has become alarmingly reliant on countries like china to supply the metals and minerals needed for both national defense and advanced technologies” “as the chinese coronavirus pandemic demonstrated any nation that is overly reliant on imports of crucial commodities faces a serious chokehold in times of crisis” dimicco said securing the domestic production of these important resources will put our nation on a stronger economic footing and grow hightech industries currently dominated by china” follow

because of an uptick in coronavirus cases in the windy city has drawn sweeping rebuke because of the mayor’s glaring hypocrisy only five days earlier she’d herself participated in a “superspreader” event to celebrate democrat presidential nominee joe biden’s ostensible 2020 election victory after biden was prematurely declared the winner of the 2020 presidential race last saturday lightfoot celebrated his professed victory by partying with her peeps in the streets without social distancing and practicing proper maskwearing video footage uploaded by her to twitter early that evening showed her speaking effectively unmasked to a tightlyknit crowd of leftists as they cheered and hollered in glee at what could only be described as a “superspreader” event watch this is a great day for our city and our country we are taking our democracy back bidenharris2020 pictwittercomoazqpd1r4y — lori lightfoot lorilightfoot november 8 2020 lightfoot had a mask on her face but it was dangling from her ear while some might argue that this is ok because “she only took her mask off to speak” that’s not how masks work “it seems simple enough but not actually wearing your mask properly will defeat the point of wearing one … don’t take the mask off to speak eat or touch your face unless you have cleaned your hands and can socially distance” guidelines from country living magazine explicitly state similar guidelines have also been published by carris health hackensack meridian health and the lehigh valley health network among many others but universal health guidelines clearly don’t matter to the chicago mayor it seems the only guidelines that do matter to her are her own draconian ones in tweets posted wednesday she declared a new “stayathome” order and ordered local residents to “cancel traditional thanksgiving plans” look a stayathome advisory for chicago will go into effect on monday november 16th at 600am this advisory calls on all chicagoans to do the following — mayor lori lightfoot chicagosmayor november 12 2020 – stay home unless for essential reasons – stop having guests over—including family members you do not live with – avoid nonessential travel – cancel traditional thanksgiving plans — mayor lori lightfoot chicagosmayor november 12 2020 effective monday i’m issuing a stayathome advisory asking all chicagoans to only leave their homes

we’re seeing shake out of the fatigue we’ve been experiencing and make the crucial difference in what our future is going to look like” she also held an official press conference her stunning remarks — made only days after lightfoot had participated in a veritable superspreader event — elicited immediate backlash look free minded residents of chicago should consider mayor lightfoot’s stay at home

just say this miss lightfoot you must practice what you preach in order to get everybody on board with this lockdown you can’t tell people stay home social distance remain 6 feet when last saturday you were in a large group celebrating” the twitter user noted lightfoot doesn’t seem to care not that it’s necessary for her to care she isn’t up for reelection for another three years so she can act as hypocritically as she desires without any fear of consequences — not that there would be any in such a farleft city that’s why the mayor isn’t concerned about her current hypocrisy and why she likewise wasn’t even remotely concerned over the backlash that erupted last spring when she was caught obtaining a haircut in defiance of her own stayathome order at the time lightfoot defended her hypocrisy by essentially arguing that because she’s mayor she’s special and thus deserves special privileges chicago mayor tells citizens that they will be arrested if they violate the stay at home

Coronavirus.,https://pjmedia.com/trending/huge-the-uk-just-dumped-chinas-huawei-in-5g-tech-roll-out-citing-its-lies-over-coronavirus/amp/?__twitter_impression=true,Qplus17,4208,574,western democracies especially the united states just heaved a huge sigh of relief after getting word that united kingdom pm boris johnson is dropping the controversial chinese tech company huawei as the nation’s provider of 5g infrastructure although johnson was in support of the chinese tech giant laying the nonsensitive portions of 5g infrastructure he said china’s lack of transparency about coronavirus made the communistrun country untrustworthy president trump attorney general william barr secretary of state mike pompeo and members of the socalled “fiveeyes” countries that share intelligence information brought huge pressure on the brits to dump huawei the us pressed hard for the uk to dump huawei because of widespread speculation that china would use the 5g infrastructure to spy and use the remote command structure for blackmail senator ted cruz has said that if the uk used huawei it would be next to impossible to share intelligence information with the ally earlier this week huawei detecting a change of heart by the brits due to anger over the coronavirus sent a threatening letter to johnson huawei’s uk chief victor zhang told british leaders that pulling up stakes now would leave britain in the “digital slow lane” “there are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence disrupting our involvement in the 5g rollout would do britain a disservice” the company is believed to be directly answerable to if not an implicit part of the chinese government the us department of justice has begun a china initiative to keep the communist behemoth from exercising its 5g advantage in a speech in february that is well worth watching and reading see below attorney general william barr said fighting for technological supremacy is about national security and western everyday life here are just some of the stakes barr a former telecom company executive and chinese studies graduate student mentioned in his speech 5g technology lies at the center of the technological and industrial world that is taking shape in essence communications networks are not just for communications anymore they are evolving into the central nervous system of the next generation of internet called the “industrial internet” and the next generation of industrial systems that will depend on that infrastructure much of the discussion on the dangers of allowing china to establish dominance in 5g has been focused on the immediate security concern of using communications networks that china can monitor and surveil that is in fact a monumental danger for that reason alone we should mobilize to surmount china’s drive to dominate 5g but the stakes are far higher than this from a national security standpoint if the industrial internet becomes dependent on chinese technology china would have the ability to shut countries off from technology and equipment upon which their consumers and industry depend the power the united states has today to use economic sanctions would pale by comparison to the unprecedented economic leverage we would be surrendering into the hands of china …some americans think that all we are talking about here is analogous to the shift from 3g to 4g in our wireless networks the jump to 5g is a quantum leap beyond this we are now talking about multigigabits per second peak rates for both download and upload devices of all kinds – some “smart” some sensors collecting and transmitting data and some actuators carrying out remote commands – can be dispersed and embedded in business and industrial equipment across a wide array of businesses such as transportation energy finance healthcare agriculture heavy construction and so forth 5g provides the commandandcontrol function for managing industrial processes as the world of 5g unfolds we will be seeing not just smart homes but smart farms smart factories smart heavy construction smart transportation systems and so forth and a host of new emerging technologies in addition to ai will become interwoven with and dependent upon 5g and the industrial internet including for example robotics the internet of things autonomous vehicles 3d printing nanotechnology biotechnology materials science energy storage and quantum computing the tory conservative party began a serious effort to claw back the contract from huawei after seeing the communist nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic its failure to report about the rampant virus attempts to corner the market on protective hospital clothing and realizing that key medications needed for survival were sourced and made in china bloomberg talked with tory members who were fighting johnson on huawei “we need to devise a proper realistic exit strategy from relying on huawei” conservative member of parliament damian green told bloomberg news “our telecom providers… need to know the government is determined to drive down huawei’s involvement to zero percent over a realistic timescale” “the mood in the parliamentary party has hardened” said tom tugendhat the conservative party’s chairman of the house of commons foreign affairs committee “it’s a shared realization of what it means for dependence on a business that is part of a state that does not share our values” tugendhat said besides unleashing the coronavirus on the world the chinese are responsible for the theft of us military technology and of hacking into the database of the office of personnel management – retrieving the 21 million real identities and personal details of american spies as well as workaday government employees — and broke into the database of equifax the tech giant is banned from the united states

national poll of 2300 us adults finds that 71 americans believe that political correctness has silenced important discussions our society needs to have the consequences are personal—58 of americans believe the political climate prevents them from sharing their own political beliefs democrats are unique however in that a slim majority 53 do not feel the need to selfcensor conversely strong majorities of republicans 73 and independents 58 say they keep some political beliefs to themselves full survey results and report found here it follows that a solid majority 59 of americans think people should be allowed to express unpopular opinions in public even those deeply offensive to others on the other hand 40 think government should prevent hate speech despite this the survey also found americans willing to censor regulate or punish a wide variety of speech and expression they personally find offensive 51 of staunch liberals say it’s “morally acceptable” to punch nazis 53 of republicans favor stripping us citizenship from people who burn the american flag 51 of democrats support a law that requires americans use transgender people’s preferred gender pronouns 65 of republicans say nfl players should be fired if they refuse to stand for the anthem 58 of democrats say employers should punish employees for offensive facebook posts 47 of republicans favor bans on

17 of conservatives agree 39 of conservatives believe it’s hate speech to say the police are racist only 17 of liberals agree 80 of liberals say it’s hateful or offensive to say illegal immigrants should be deported only 36 of conservatives agree 87 of liberals say it’s hateful or offensive to say women shouldn’t fight in military combat roles while 47 of conservatives agree 90 of liberals say it’s hateful or offensive to say homosexuality is a sin while 47 of conservatives agree americans oppose hate speech bans but say hate speech is morally unacceptable although americans oppose 59 outright bans on public hate speech that doesn’t mean they think hate speech is acceptable an overwhelming majority 79 say it’s “morally unacceptable” to say offensive things about racial or religious groups black hispanic and white americans disagree about how free speech operates african americans and hispanics are more likely than white americans to believe free speech does more to protect majority opinions not minority viewpoints 59 49 34 supporting someone’s right to say racist things is as bad as holding racist views yourself 65 61 34 people who don’t respect others don’t deserve the right of free speech 59 62 36 hate speech is an act of violence 75 72 46 our society can prohibit hate speech and still protect free speech 69 71 49 people usually have bad intentions when they express offensive opinions 70 75 52 however black hispanic and white americans agree that free speech ensures the truth will ultimately prevail 68 70 66 majorities also agree that it would be difficult to ban hate speech since people can’t agree what hate speech is 59 77 87 twothirds say colleges aren’t doing enough to teach the value of free speech twothirds of americans 66 say colleges and universities aren’t doing enough to teach young americans today about the value of free speech when asked which is more important 65 say colleges should expose students to “all types of viewpoints even if they are offensive or biased against certain groups” about a third 34 say colleges should “prohibit offensive speech that is biased against certain groups” but americans are conflicted despite their desire for viewpoint diversity a slim majority 53 also agree that “colleges have an obligation to protect students from offensive speech and ideas that could create a difficult learning environment” this share rises to 66 among democrats 57 of republicans disagree 76 say students shutting down offensive speakers reveals “broader pattern” of how students cope more than threefourths 76 of americans say that recent campus protests and cancellations of controversial speakers are part of a “broader pattern” of how college students deal with offensive ideas about a quarter 22 think these protests and shutdowns are simply isolated incidents however when asked about specific speakers about half of americans with college experience think a wide variety should not be allowed to speak at their college a speaker who says that all white people are racist 51 a speaker who says muslims shouldn’t be allowed to come to the us 50 a speaker who says that transgender people have a mental disorder 50 a speaker who publicly criticizes and disrespects the police 49 a speaker who says all christians are backwards and brainwashed 49 a speaker who says the average iq of whites and asians is higher than african americans and hispanics 48 a speaker who says the police are justified in stopping african americans at higher rates than other groups 48 a speaker who says all illegal immigrants should be deported 41 a speaker who says men on average are better at math than women 40 nevertheless few endorse shutting down speakers by shouting loudly 4 or forcing the speaker off the stage 3 current college and graduate students aren’t much different only about 7 support forcibly shutting down offensive speakers 65 say colleges should discipline students who shut down invited campus speakers twothirds 65 say colleges need to discipline students who disrupt invited speakers and prevent them from speaking however the public is divided about how 46 want to give students a warning 31 want the incident noted on the student’s academic record 22 want them to pay a fine 20 want to suspend them 19 favor arresting the students 13 want to fully expel the students threefourths 75 of republicans support some form of punishment for these students compared to 42 of democrats people of color don’t find most microaggressions offensive the survey finds that many microaggressions colleges and universities advise faculty and students to avoid aren’t considered offensive by most people of color the percentage of african americans and latinos who say these microaggressions are not offensive are as follows telling a recent immigrant “you speak good english” black 67 latino 77 telling a racial minority “you are so articulate” black 56 latino 63 saying “i don’t notice people’s race” black 71 latino 80 saying “america is a melting pot” black 77 latino 70 saying “everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough” black 77 latino 89 saying “america is the land of opportunity” black 93 latino 89 the one microaggression that african americans 68 agree is offensive is telling a racial minority “you are a credit to your race” americans don’t think colleges need to advise students on halloween costumes nearly twothirds 65 say colleges shouldn’t advise students about offensive halloween costumes and should instead let students work it out on their own a third 33 think it is the responsibility of the university to remind students not to wear costumes that stereotype racial or ethnic groups at offcampus parties 20 of current students say college faculty has balanced mix of political views only 20 of current college and graduate students believe their college or university faculty has a balanced mix of political views a plurality 39 say most college and university professors are liberal 27 believe most are politically moderate and 12 believe most are conservative democratic and republican students see their college campuses differently a majority 59 of republican college students believe that most faculty members are liberal in contrast only 35 of democratic college students agree most professors are liberal what beliefs should get people fired americans tend to oppose firing people for their beliefs nevertheless democrats are more likely than republicans to say a business executive should be fired if she or he believes transgender people have a mental disorder 44 vs 14 that homosexuality is a sin 32 vs 10 and that psychological differences help explain why there are more male than female engineers 34 vs 14 conversely republicans are more likely than democrats to say a business executive should be fired if they burned the american flag at a weekend political protest 54 vs 38 republicans say journalists are an enemy of the american people a majority 63 of republicans agree with president trump that journalists today are an “enemy of the american people” conversely most americans 64 as well as 89 of democrats and 61 of independents do not view journalists as the enemy these results aren’t surprising given that most americans believe many major news outlets have a liberal bias including the new york times 52 cnn 50 and msnbc 59 fox is the one news station in which a majority 56 believe it has a conservative bias democrats however believe most major news organizations are balanced in their reporting including the new york times 55 cnn 55 and cbs 72 a plurality 44 also believe the wall street journal is balanced the two exceptions are that a plurality 47 believe msnbc has a liberal tilt and a strong majority 71 say fox has a conservative bias republicans on the other hand see things differently overwhelming majorities believe liberal bias colors reporting at the new york times 80 cnn 81 cbs 73 and msnbc 80 a plurality also feel the wall street journal 48 has a liberal bias one exception is that a plurality 44 believe fox news has a conservative bias while 41 believe it provides unbiased reporting despite perceptions of bias only 29 of the public want the government to prevent media outlets from publishing a story that government officials say is biased or inaccurate instead a strong majority 70 say government should not have the power to stop such news stories americans say wedding businesses should be required to serve lgbt people not weddings the public distinguishes between a business serving people and servicing weddings a plurality 50 of americans say that businesses should be required to “provide services to gay and lesbian people” even if doing so violates the business owners’ religious beliefs but 68 say a baker should not be required to provide a specialorder wedding cake for a samesex wedding if doing so violates their religious convictions few support punishing wedding businesses who refuse service to samesex weddings twothirds 66 say nothing should happen to a bakery which refuses to bake a cake for a samesex wedding a fifth 20 would boycott the bakery another 22 think government should sanction the bakery in some way such as fining the bakery 12 requiring an apology 10 issuing a warning 8 taking away their business license 6 or sending the baker to jail 1

of some russian disinformation campaign” he continued “it’s simply not true” ratcliffe said that schiff “wants anything against his preferred political candidate to be deemed as not real and is using

have to kill people when they shoot them couldn’t they be more humane and just aim for arms or legs as reported in force science news new york state senator david paterson dharlem pondered those questions in 2006 and concluded that officers were needlessly killing suspects in response he introduced legislation that would require officers to try to shoot offenders’ limbs instead of targeting locations that would more likely stop the threat but could also result in death paterson proposed that any officer who employed more than the minimum force necessary to stop a lifethreatening suspect be charged with felony manslaughter law enforcement exploded in protest and paterson withdrew the bill but the battle isn’t over the new york post has just reported that brooklyn assembly members annette robinson dbedford stuyvesant and darryl towns deast new york have introduced a “minimum force” bill that would require officers to “shoot a suspect in the arm or the leg” and to use firearms “with the intent to stop rather than kill” “when i encounter civilian response to officerinvolved shootings it’s very often ‘why didn’t they just shoot him in the leg’” dr bill lewinski executive director of the force science institute told force science news in a 2006 interview centered on paterson’s proposed legislation “when civilians judge police shooting deaths–on juries on review boards in the media in the community–this same argument is often brought forward shooting to wound is naively regarded as a reasonable means of stopping dangerous behavior “in reality this thinking is a result of ‘training by hollywood’ in which movie and tv cops are able to do anything to control the outcomes of events that serve the director’s dramatic interests it reflects a misconception of reallife dynamics and ends up imposing unrealistic expectations of skill on reallife officers” vice president joe biden agrees when michael paladino president of new york’s detectives endowment association showed him the bill he reportedly scoffed and suggested that it be called the “john wayne bill” because of the unrealistic movielike sharpshooting skills it demands of officers in light of this resurfacing of misguided “shoottowound” thinking force science news is reissuing a “position paper” originally introduced following paterson’s ’06 proposed legislation that discusses why shooting to wound versus shooting to stop is neither practical nor desirable as a performance standard we hope this information proves useful to you in addressing any shoottowound advocacy that may arise in your jurisdiction practical issues robinson and towns’ bill was drafted in the wake of the controversial shooting of sean bell who died after new york officers fired a total of 50 rounds at him and two other men sen paterson said his proposed legislation in ’06 was motivated by the fatal shooting in new york city of amadou diallo who was struck by 19 bullets when officers mistakenly thought he was reaching for a weapon as they approached him for questioning paterson believed that shooting an arm or leg would tend to stop a suspect’s threatening actions precluding the need to shoot to the head or chest where death is more probable by requiring only the least amount of force needed to control a suspect he apparently hoped to reduce the likelihood of “excessive” shots being fired studies by the force science research center reveal some of the practical problems with these positions lewinski explains some of the basics of human dynamics and anatomy and the relative risks of misses and hits “hands and arms can be the fastestmoving body parts for example an average suspect can move his hand and forearm across his body to a 90degree angle in 12100 of a second he can move his hand from his hip to shoulder height in 18100 of a second “the average officer pulling the trigger as fast as he can on a glock one of the fastest cycling semiautos requires 14 second to discharge each round “there is no way an officer can react track shoot and reliably hit a threatening suspect’s forearm or a weapon in a suspect’s hand in the time spans involved “even if the suspect held his weapon arm steady for half a second or more an accurate hit would be highly unlikely and in police shootings the suspect and his weapon are seldom stationary plus the officer himself may be moving as he shoots “the upper arms move more slowly than the lower arms and hands but shooting at the upper arms there’s a greater chance you’re going to hit the suspect’s brachial artery or center mass areas with a high probability of fatality so where does shooting only to wound come in when even areas considered by some to ‘safe’ from fatality risk could in fact carry the same level of risk as targeting center mass “legs tend initially to move slower than arms and to maintain more static positions however areas of the lower trunk and upper thigh are rich with vascularity a suspect who’s hit there can bleed out in seconds if one of the major arteries is severed so again shooting just to wound may not result in just wounding “on the other hand if an officer manages to take a suspect’s legs out nonfatally that still leaves the offender’s hands free to shoot his ability to threaten lives hasn’t necessarily been stopped” as to preventing socalled “overkill” from shots that are fired after a threat is neutralized lewinski offers these observations “twenty years ago officers were trained to ’shoot then assess’ they fired 1 or 2 rounds then stopped to see the effect this required 14 to 12 second during which time the suspect could keep firing if he hadn’t been incapacitated “now they’re taught to ‘shoot and assess’ to judge the effect of their shots as they continue to fire an ongoing process this allows the officer to continually defend himself but because the brain is trying to do 2 things at once–shoot and assess–a very significant change in the offender’s behavior needs to take place in order for the officer to recognize the change of circumstances “a suspect falling to the ground from being shot would be a significant change but by analyzing the way people fall we’ve determined that it takes 23 of a second to a full second or more for a person to fall to the ground from a standing position and that is when they’ve been hit in a motor center that produces instant loss of muscle tension “while an officer is noticing this change he is going to continue firing if he is shooting as fast as he can under the stress of trying to save his life on average from the time an officer perceives a change in stimulus to the time he is able to process that and actually stop firing 2 to 3 additional rounds will be expended “shooting beyond the moment a threat is neutralized is not a willful malicious action in most cases it’s an involuntary factor of human dynamics “given what science tells us about armed encounters this most recent proposal is a fantasy just like paterson’s legislation before it they would hold officers to superhuman performance and punish them criminally for being unable to achieve it” legal issues a shoottowound mandate would “not be valid legally” because it sets a standard far beyond that established by graham v connor the benchmark us supreme court decision on police use of force says former prosecutor jeff chudwin now chief of the olympia fields il pd and president of the illinois tactical officers assn recognizing that violent encounters are “tense uncertain and rapidly evolving” the court “does not require officers to use the least intrusive method” of forcefully controlling a threatening suspect but “only what’s reasonable” chudwin explains when an officer’s life or that of a third party appears in jeopardy shooting can be justified as reasonable by legal definition the possible consequences of deadly force include both death and great bodily harm “the law has never broken these two apart” chudwin says which is what these proposals have tried to do “the politicians who propose this kind of legislation are saying that police should only shoot someone just a little bit deadly force is not about ‘just a little bit’ any time you fire a firearm there’s a substantial risk of great bodily harm or death the law doesn’t even so much as suggest that deadly force should be just enough to wound but with no probability of death that’s plain wrong legally and tactically and sends the wrong message” attorney bill everett a former riskmanagement executive useofforce instructor former leo and force science national advisory board member agrees as he explains it use of force from a legal standpoint is a matter of “proportionality” and there are two ways to measure it what’s necessary and what’s reasonable he draws the analogy of a house being on fire “firefighters can pour what seems at the time to be about the right amount of water on it to stop the fire versus not using one drop more of water than necessary even in hindsight to put the fire out” the former fits the “reasonable” approach the latter is the “necessary” perspective and is the essence of the shoottowoundminimal force bill “when you impose a standard of strict necessity you require officers to do a whole lot of thinking in a situation where the supreme court recognizes there’s not a whole lot of time to think in” everett declares under a shoottowound directive “an officer faced with a suspect running at him with a jagged bottle is expected to think about getting target acquisition on an arm or a leg while his own life is at risk” the hesitation it is likely to create will only heighten his risk the critical issue of officer survival aside everett predicts that the kind of legislation proposed would “substantially expand the civil and criminal liability of police officers” he asks “what if an officer tries to wing a suspect and ends up hitting an innocent bystander what about the liability there what if an officer tries to shoot an offender’s limb but shoots him in the chest instead how does his true intent get judged “right now under the supreme court’s prevailing standard lawyers and judges in a large percentage of police shootings can look at the facts and conclude that there is no basis for allowing a civil suit to go to trial but if you change the standard there’ll be a lot more cases going to juries to evaluate 1 did the officer intend to wound or did he intend to kill the suspect and 2 was the suspect’s death absolutely necessary a trial will become the rule rather than the exception “who in their right mind would become a police officer in a jurisdiction where shootto wound and standards of strict necessity became the law those ideas may have some humanitarian appeal but once you go beyond the disneyish attraction and face the reality support for this thinking has to evaporate” tactical issues modern training teaches that when an officer uses deadly force the intent should be to stop the suspect’s threatening behavior as fast as possible in the words of firearms trainer ron avery himself a championship shooter head of the practical shooting academy and a member of the force science technical advisory board shooting for an assailant’s center mass is usually considered the most effective first option because the upper torso combines a concentration of vital areas and major blood vessels within the body’s largest target “when the risk of failure is death an officer needs the highest percentage chance of success he can get” everett notes shooting instead for a smaller fastermoving arm or a leg with the intent to wound rather than to incapacitate invites a myriad of tactical dilemmas for instance • an officer’s survival instinct may exert an overpowering influence on target selection “i don’t care how good a shot you are” says avery “if your life is threatened you’re going to go for the surer thing first and worry about your assailant’s life being saved second if a guy is running at me with a blade the last thing i’m going to be thinking is ‘i’m going to shoot him in the arm’” hence shooting for center mass may become a psychological default • poor shot placement is bound to increase even when officers are trying to shoot center mass they often miss lewinski recalls a case he was involved in where an officer firing under high stress just 5 feet from an offender failed to hit him at all with the first 5 rounds and connected with the next four only because the suspect moved into his line of fire “hitting an arm or a leg on a moving suspect with surgical precision will be virtually impossible” avery asserts “i could probably count on one hand the individuals who can make that kind of shot under the pressure of their life on the line expecting that level of performance by police officers on an agencywide basis is ludicrous” misses may well go on to injure or kill someone else • use of certain weapons might be discouraged “because of the spread pattern an officer might be precluded from grabbing a shotgun for fear of hitting more vital areas when he tries to shoot to wound” everett speculates “if the offender has a fully automatic weapon say should an officer be prevented from using the best defensive weapon he may have because it might have sweep or rise” • “successful” shots could be dangerous to people besides the suspect because of throughandthrough penetration “virtually every police round today is designed to penetrate heavy clothing and 10 to 12 inches of ballistic gel” explains chudwin “rounds with that capability will penetrate even the biggest arms” and could like misses then travel on to hit unintended targets in the background • “successful” shots that don’t persuade an offender to quit leave the officer still in peril when we know from street experience that even multiple centermass hits don’t always stop determined deranged or drugged attackers “how many officers would be murdered by offenders who get shot in a limb and are still fully capable of shooting back” chudwin asks indeed avery believes that shooting an offender without incapacitating him “may just infuriate him so he doubles his effort to kill you there is no dependable correlation between wounding someone and making them stop” • “shooting to wound reflects a misapplication of police equipment “lesslethal options should be attempted only with tools designed for that purpose” avery says “if you deliberately use deadly force to bring people into custody without incapacitating them you’re using the wrong tool for that job also if you shoot them in the arm or leg and you destroy muscle tissue shatter bone or destroy nerve function you have maimed that person for life now attorneys can play the argument of ‘cruel and unusual punishment’ and pursue punitive damages for destroying the capacity of your ‘victim’ to earn wages and so on you don’t try to just wound people with a gun period” the experts we consulted agreed that advocates who push a shoottowound agenda appear to understand little about human dynamics ballistics tactics force legalities or the challenges officers face on the street chudwin has found that these critics of police practices can often be enlightened if they are invited to experience force decisionmaking scenarios on a firearms simulator avery has a more dramatic if fanciful idea “put them in a cage with a lion” he suggests “then let’s see if they shoot to wound” special thanks to ron barber at in the line of duty whose enewsletter alerted force science to this recent

the predicament that is being faced at the moment to try to create a debate and try to explain how we feel there needs to be a fair and level playing field” the debate comes just weeks after 18time tennis grand slam singles champion martina navratilova said it was “cheating” to allow transgender women to compete in female sporting competitions because they had unfair physical advantages “i am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers but i would not be happy to compete against her it would not be fair” navratilova wrote in the sunday times “to put the argument at its most basic a man can decide to be female take hormones if required by whatever sporting organisation is concerned win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune and then reverse his decision and go back to making babies if he so desires “it’s insane and it’s cheating” a spokesperson for the stonewall charity said “sport should be welcoming to everyone including trans people we need clubs and governing bodies as the experts to consider how their sports’ individual policies can work to be as inclusive as possible and what advice and guidance they’re giving to ensure all people including trans people can take part in sport”

people's livelihoods ever have their own livelihood impacted,"" the Waffle House CEO recently told Business Insider.",https://fee.org/articles/waffle-house-s-stand-against-lockdowns-is-exactly-what-america-needs-almost/,Nuncle_Milty,3872,1740,walt ehmer the ceo of waffle house didn’t mince words when he explained his biggest problem with economic lockdowns stemming from the covid19 pandemic none of the people who make the decisions to shut down businesses and impact peoples livelihoods ever have their own livelihood impacted ehmer recently told business insider there’s clearly some hyperbole in the statement after all everyone is impacted to some degree by the lockdowns but ehmer’s larger point is correct the people shutting down the economy are not being affected by lockdowns to the same extent others are when the coronavirus swept across america earlier this spring waffle house which has locations in 25 states was forced to shut down some 700 restaurants across the country this put roughly 28000 hourly waffle house employees out of work who became part of the 265 million americans who filed for unemployment that month the story of these workers underscores an overlooked reality of the pandemic lowerincome americans are being harmed the most by lockdowns pew research studies show that hispanic women immigrants young people and individuals with less education have been the most likely to lose jobs and the least likely to save income during the pandemic they’ve also been by far the most likely to say they’ve struggled to pay rent or bills the people ordering lockdowns are not the ones struggling to pay rentbills data show lowerincome americans are by far the ones most squeezed politicians must stop depriving people from earning a living by clinging to the fiction they can protect people from this virus pictwittercomi4ncng9zxn — jon miltimore miltimore79 november 19 2020 ehmer says many people don’t seem to realize the harm that’s being done to the people who can least afford it a lockdown is going to put a lot of people out of work ehmer added in his interview its really not about the business — its about the people these people have jobs they have livelihoods they need to take care of their families it’s safe to say the politicians ordering these lockdowns have not suffered the same way for starters they still have their jobs but it’s also more than that the reality is that many politicians have probably seen their wealth increase the lockdowns have been hell on main street but great for wall street the dow jones industrial average hit an alltime high this week in large part because so many corporations have seen their competition sidelined increasing their market share but the inequities of the pandemic go beyond wealth time and again the pandemic has shown that politicians have not been subjected to the rules and regulations they pass in the same way every day americans have they can make a quick phone call to buy jewelry at stores that are officially closed as new mexico gov michelle lujan grisham did back in april they can arrange an appointment with a stylist while salons are closed because these businesses are “not essential” unless you appear on tv in which case they are very essential as house speaker nancy pelosi and chicago mayor lori lightfoot did or like philadelphia mayor jim kenney they can ban indoor dining for others while sneaking out for a bite to eat on the sly exclusive weve obtained photos of governor gavin newsom at the napa dinner party hes in hot water over the photos call into question just how outdoors the dinner was a witness who took photos tells us his group was so loud the sliding doors had to be closed 10pm on foxla pictwittercomgtovewa864 — bill melugin billfoxla november 18 2020 these actions might earn lawmakers some bad press but that pales in comparison to what restaurants have endured during the pandemic eateries like waffle house have been among the industries hardest hit by the lockdowns many do not see eating out as an “essential” activity until a close friend’s birthday comes up that is and research has shown that eating out like gyms poses a greater risk of spreading the virus than other activities it’s certainly true that some activities are going to pose greater risks than others but the reality is that only individuals can determine how much risk is worth taking to engage in a given activity see milton friedman explain this idea to a student in the video below this is a truth lawmakers too often ignore when gavin newsom broke his own covid19 dining restrictions to enjoy dinner with friends he knew there was a risk he might contract the virus but he determined that the risk was worth the value of a night out when bill de blasio went to the gym to work out while other new yorkers were forbidden to do so he knew there was risk—but he similarly determined the risk was worth the rewards of exercise to be clear i’m not saying newsom and de blasio should not do these things because they come with risks i’m saying everyone should be able to determine how much risk they’re willing to take to engage in a given activity this is how ehmer is approaching his work at waffle house he’s not denying that there are risks to dining out or going to work he’s saying these risks need to be balanced against the damage being done from lockdowns the people making the decisions are not paying the same price that the workers in this country are paying ehmer added “im not going to work in an unsafe environment and im not going to let our folks work in an unsafe environment when he says he works “side by side” with folks ehmer isn’t being metaphorical when business insider interviewed the waffle house ceo he was in the back of one of the chain’s memphis locations wearing a polo uniform like the workers he doesn’t sit on zoom calls all day talking to managers at locations but visits four to seven restaurants every day to work shouldertoshoulder with the employees who are delivering a service to customers the true way to solve a crisis is to go stand in the middle of it and figure out how to take care of people and figure out how to help put things back together ehmer said that does not change regardless of what the crisis is this might sound reckless to some people but it’s a clear sign of leadership it also reveals a basic economic reality that many of today’s decision makers often forget everyone does not have the ability to work from home njeri boss waffle’s house’s public relations manager told business insider back in april unlike many of us restaurant workers and owners don’t have the luxury of working from home these jobs and eateries may matter little to the decision makers but the national restaurant association points out that countless livelihoods are at stake because of the aggressive measures lawmakers are taking to slow the spread of the virus “tens of thousands of additional restaurant bankruptcies — and millions of lost jobs — are now more likely while the science remains inconclusive on whether any health benefits will accrue the nra said in a letter sent to the national governors association on tuesday for this reason ehmer says waffle house restaurants will remain open unless they are forced to shut down by lawmakers were trying to provide reliable careers and jobs for people” ehmer said”we work side by side with folks” ehmer’s stance against lockdowns is courageous but ultimately bolder action may be required to save businesses from the pernicious effects of lockdowns adhering to government orders that force businesses to close their doors may seem like the only sensible action to take but there is another way— as elon musk has shown in may the tesla founder simply refused to adhere to a government order forcing tesla’s car plant in fremont california to remain closed “tesla is restarting production today against alameda county rules i will be on the line with everyone else” musk tweeted “if anyone is arrested i ask that it only be me” tesla is restarting production today against alameda county rules i will be on the line with everyone else if anyone is arrested i ask that it only be me — elon musk elonmusk may 11 2020 many would view musk’s action as radical but as fee’s dan sanchez pointed out it was the embodiment of civil disobedience a form of peaceful protest that is perhaps the most effective tool for fighting injustice in modern history musk is not seizing government buildings he is just asserting his right to open tesla’s private property to willing employees and to pay them to produce cars to sell to willing buyers and he expressly offered himself up for arrest should the government decide to invade private property and cage him for it it may seem sacrilegious to include an eccentric billionaire in the same tradition as such heroic figures as king and gandhi but i would argue that economic freedom is as worthy a cause as any our very lives livelihoods and living standards depend on production and commerce if civil disobedience is ever justified surely it is for the sake of providing for ourselves and our children​ musk’s act of civil disobedience paid off government officials caved and allowed tesla to reopen musk’s peaceful defiance would have made henry david thoreau proud “disobedience is the true foundation of liberty” the author wrote in his seminal work civil disobedience “the obedient must be slaves” ehmer’s opposition to lockdowns should be applauded but eventually it may require more than words to break the lockdown spell it may require peaceful but assertive action additional reading

adolescent girls” shrier explained at quillette last weekend “i fully support medical transition for mature adults and i have no desire to be a provocateur … nor do i have any prurient interest in others’ social lives” “what i aim to do as a journalist is to investigate cultural phenomena and here was one worth investigating between 2016 and 2017 the number of females seeking gender surgery quadrupled in the united states” she outlined “thousands of teen girls across the western world are not only selfdiagnosing with a real dysphoric condition they likely do not have in many cases they are obtaining hormones and surgeries following the most cursory diagnostic processes schoolteachers therapists doctors surgeons and medicalaccreditation organizations are all rubberstamping these transitions often out of fear that doing otherwise will be reported as a sign of ‘transphobia’ —despite growing evidence that most young people who present as trans will eventually desist and so these interventions will do more harm than good” “the notion that this sudden wave of transitioning among teens is a worrying ideologically driven phenomenon is hardly a fringe view” the author emphasized

once said “every calculation based on experience elsewhere fails in new mexico”in so many ways wallace was prescient about this beautiful poor and unique state in the american southwest one “calculation” about modern politics that would especially perplex him is the fact that a relatively poor but oilrich western state elects politicians that are so directly at odds with its economic best interestafter texas and north dakota new mexico is the thirdlargest oilproducing state in the us the oil and gas industries combine to generate roughly 40 percent of its annual budget furthermore new mexico’s oil and gas resources are heavily concentrated on lands managed by the federal government the central role of energy especially energy extracted within the state’s borders and controlled by federal policymakers might lead one to believe that new mexicans would vote for proenergy republicans in federal electionsinstead new mexico has become a safely blue state it narrowly went for

economy and that the biden administration’s energy policies are a dagger aimed at the heart of new mexico’s economythat “dagger” comes in the form of the numerous sometimes clear often conflicting statements that candidate biden made during the campaign it is unclear what biden will do about hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” which enables oil and gas producers to access previously inaccessible oil and gas sources he backed away from an outright nationwide ban late in the campaign however biden has clearly stated that he would ban new gas and oil permits including fracking on federal landstargeting federal lands would devastate new mexico’s oil and gas industry and its economy because of the state’s large federal estate according to the institute for energy research 347 percent of the land in new mexico is federal in fiscal year 2019 new mexico received energyrelated disbursement from the federal bureau of land management of 117 billion the highest payment made in any state wyoming was next with 641 million and then colorado with 108 million this was the highest payment from the bureau in the state’s history and compares with 455 million in fy 2017 a vast majority of this increased revenue is a result of frackingfurthermore data from the global energy institute indicate that if energy production on federal lands were banned new mexico would lose 24300 jobs 10000 direct 14300 indirect and induced a significant hit for a state with a workforce of around 900000 making matters worse a good number of the “direct” jobs lost are goodpaying something that is not easy to find in new mexico a state that consistently ranks among the poorest in the nation and has been hardhit by the covid19 pandemic closing new mexico’s federal lands to energy production entirely would cost the state 496 million in annual royalty collections representing 8 percent of the state’s total general fund revenuesbiden’s proposed fracking ban is even too much for new mexico’s democratic governor michelle lujan grisham who has said that she’ll ask for an exemption from any future drilling ban acknowledging the taxrevenue contributions to education funding grisham explained to the new mexico oil and gas association conference in santa fe last october that “without the energy effort in this state no one gets to make education the top priority”to be sure lujan grisham is broadly supportive of biden’s energy policies she’s even on the presidentelect’s short list for administration positions both of them have stated that they would like to “transition out of fossil fuels” despite new mexico’s financial dependence on the industrybut biden’s aggressive antifossilfuels stance as it relates to federal land not only puts him at odds with lujan grisham it puts him far to the left of president obama on the issue in a 2012 presidential debate obama stated “we’ve opened up public lands we’re actually drilling more on public lands than the previous administration and natural gas isn’t just appearing magically we’re encouraging it and working with the industry”president obama was of course considered an environmentalist by political opponents and supporters alike his support for naturalgas right isn’t difficult to reconcile with his environmental track record that’s because when used in a new power plants natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less co2 than a typical new coal plantobama understood the vast benefits of natural gas including the fact that it was appropriate to drill for it on federal lands during his tenure naturalgas production rose some 35 percent from approximately 21 million cubic feet to more than 284 million cubic feetif he truly cares about the environment biden would be wise to follow his predecessor’s playbook according to the epa us net greenhousegas emissions went down by 10 percent from 2005 to 2018 and much of the contribution to that decline in recent years was “due to an increasing shift to use of less carbon dioxideintensive natural gas for generating electricity and a rapid increase in the use of renewable energy in the electric power sector” but if naturalgas prices rise and a ban on federal leasing is likely to contribute to higher prices these positive developments could go into reverse the energy information administration recently projected that higher naturalgas prices would cause coal’s share of power generation to increase from 18 percent to 22 percent in 2021obama also signed into law legislation that ended the us government’s restrictions on crudeoil exports back in 2015during the campaign biden faced tremendous pressure from the left wing of his political base to come out for policies such the green new deal and bans on fracking and other fossilfuelbased energy production biden has never been associated with such hardleft stances against economic policy and growth in the past remember even obama is to the right of where biden campaignedlets hope that president biden has a more realistic approach to energy than did candidate biden new mexico’s economic future is certainly at stake but so is the recovery of our nation’s virushobbled economyrather than instituting a blanket ban on production of oil and gas on federal lands a better approach would be to recognize the benefits and work to make sure that any production is handled responsibly and safely the growing american energy sector and american energy independence have delivered wins for the environment for consumers and for the us and state economies such as new mexico’s let’s keep it that way

schools so ignorant of communisms horrors that they see no problem in courting dabbling with or even passively accepting one of history’s most noxious ideologies my child’s catholic school sent home a letter to parents this week recommending “conversations about white privilege” to encourage “compassionate hearts and confident minds” regurgitating the radicalleft bile that fuels the fires of resentment and division will not enrich students emotionally or intellectually instead catholic schools should teach students about the evils of marxism marxist apostles are orchestrating the chaos and violence plaguing our streets and undermining our selfgovernment pope john paul ii once said “if you want to understand the enemy you have to know what he has written” to start you must know what the enemy has done students need to learn about the gross violations suffered under 20thcentury communist regimes with a focus on the catholic fight against it as well as the atrocities committed against catholic communities instead of encouraging students to feel bad about the skin color god gave them catholic schools should share lessons from last century’s experiment in communist totalitarianism agespecific curricula should explore the church’s social teaching and its rejection of all variants of socialism the brutal persecutions under communism and the heroic examples of catholic martyrs we cannot allow another generation to emerge from our schools so ignorant of the horrors of communism that they see no problem in courting dabbling with or even just passively accepting one of history’s most noxious ideologies culture’s capitulation to marxism the church has emphatically rejected marxism as a way of effecting social political and economic change in 1891 pope leo xiii warned that radical socialism exploits social tensions by engaging in violent uprisings that pit “man against man” for the church conflict and injustice of any kind are rooted in sin for which there can be no remedy apart from god as st paul said in his letter to the ephesians “a world without god is a world without hope” pope john paul ii similarly condemned an ideology that removes moral restraints strips the individual of rights and freedoms robs human personality of its dignity and reduces man to a mere cog in the state machine marxism fosters enmity and resentment by claiming partial truths offering deluded promises and delivering nothing but hatred violence and destruction partisan interest overtakes the common good and destroys whatever stands in its way the marxist’s violent crusade against any form of resistance has been well summarized in recent weeks by various protest leaders black lives matter leader hawk newsome threatened on national television that “if this country doesn’t give us what we want then we will burn down the system and replace it” one of the leaders of seattle’s capitol hill occupied protest warned “you cannot rebuild until you break it all the way down” how has the country responded to such demands by falling in line streets have been renamed police dismantled educators fired and history scrubbed the liquidation of socalled political enemies and hostile ideas is the communist legacy in every country it has ravaged for much of the last century half of europe was under its influence perceived adversaries — men women and children of every race and creed — were surveilled informed on arrested without charge imprisoned tortured deported and executed communists often turned on each other fabricating trumpedup charges against swaths of the political elite as occurred during joseph stalin’s notorious show trials of the 1930s and the slanksy trials in czechoslovakia in the 1950s captive to its own lies communism brutally suppresses anything that risks exposing the system for the sham it is communism hates catholicism the church has been on every communist hit list from the early 1900s it should not have surprised anyone when radical left activist shaun king tweeted last week that all images and statues of jesus and the blessed mother should be torn down and when statues of spanish missionary st junipero serra were toppled archbishop of new york cardinal timothy dolan rightly expressed concern this week that once our culture starts banning historical works that depict prejudice and wrongdoing the bible won’t be safe the reality is that any marxist organization will eventually turn its attention to denigrating the church not only is marxism irreconcilable with christianity it vehemently opposes it and seeks its destruction communist regimes openly and shamelessly seek to erase all remembrance of christianity and christian civilization from the hearts and minds of the faithful their efforts are insidious at first catholics relinquished freedoms as communists compromised the rule of law sooner or later to varying degrees and intensity every regime suppressed public worship closed religious orders confiscated church property desecrated and seized churches laicized religious schools and transferred catholic institutions such as hospitals and orphanages to the state countless catholic bishops priests and laypeople throughout the world have been deported imprisoned tortured and executed then they “disappear” the church that had been brutally persecuted during the first 300 years of its establishment once again became the church of martyrs writing in 1937 when the worst horrors of communism were yet to be unleashed pope pius xi said the barbarism overtaking the communist world surpassed in scale and violence even the oppression of the early church under rome the ‘satanic scourge’ of communism in the soviet union the bolshevik revolution plunged the church into a 70year period of persecution by the time the soviet union collapsed in the late 1980s the catholic church in russia had been nearly obliterated the oppression in albania which in 1967 officially declared itself the first constitutionally atheistic state was even worse by the time religious services were permitted in 1990 for the first time in 56 years albania’s only cardinal resumed his duties having spent 37 years in prison camps the details of the torture and executions in these camps are enough to make your hair stand on end imprisonment and even execution awaited families who gave religious instruction at home prayed the rosary possessed religious literature made the sign of the cross or even gave their children catholic names in romania the communist party came to power in 1948 and within a year no catholic bishops were active and almost all churches had been closed priests were being murdered as late as 1982 this glimpse of the “satanic scourge” of communism as pope pius xi described it is just a sample of what students should be learning catholic schools need to emphasize what successive popes have unequivocally declared there is no ideological compromise between christianity and a system that has sought to “cancel” god we need to nurture in young people the spiritual fire and intellectual confidence to confront divisive “white privilege” rhetoric which are empty ideological slogans and pseudoscience of neomarxists students should arrive on university campuses prepared to evangelize their faith in the knowledge that jesus alone redeems our sins

opponent not entering the race until june 2020 somehow the campaigns of fishbein and jinks were misled by incomplete vote counts to believe jinks had won the election however wallingford town clerk

polls not those published in the state’s election reporting system ritter declined any further comment until he and his staff could get more details “i just heard about it two minutes ago” ritter said these updated results mean a swing of more than 100 votes in the tally from jinks to fishbein representative vincent j candelora r the new house gop leader said “what a roller coaster” as of wednesday

error or a computer error in the elections management system all i know is we caught it yesterday and amended it” the tally on the state’s election reporting system now shows fishbein with 7058 votes and 7037 for jinks or 5007 to 4993 under state law a recount is automatic when the race is settled by a margin of less than 050 the difference in the 90th house district is about 015 that wallingford

“so obviously voting by mail makes a lot of sense to me now i need the lawyers to figure out how to draft that” using the pandemic as background secretary of state merrill sent every voter in the state an unsolicited application for an absentee ballot the state constitution however would need to be amended to allow mailin and early voting for any reason at all “connecticut is in the neanderthal era” blumenthal said just as mailin ballots are a focus of intense controversy in the presidential election under normal circumstances the deadline for reporting final results are within 48 hours after an election in this election the deadline was extended to 96 hours because of the expected heavy use of absentee ballots during the covid19 pandemic the effective deadline was monday

juoa9o,2020-11-15 18:12:22,Conservative,New York Times Finally Admits the Black Lives Matter Riots Left 'Long-Term Economic Damage',https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/tyler-o-neil/2020/11/11/new-york-times-finally-admits-the-black-lives-matter-riots-left-long-term-economic-damage-n1136376,IIRC,3698,653,on monday the new york times belatedly published an article recounting the horrific damage that the black lives matter riots wreaked on kenosha wisc the article’s timing seems particularly suspect — it appears the times which ran interference for the black lives matter rioters throughout the summer only decided to cover the fallout from the riots after the paper joined others in calling the presidential race for democratic nominee joe biden in the story the times‘ nellie bowles acknowledged that insurance only goes so far when it comes to making business owners whole in the wake of riots and looting bowles cited the book in defense of looting which claims that “looting is an essential tactic against a racist capitalist society and a largely victimless crime… because stores will be made whole through insurance” after the philadelphia inquirer dared to publish an oped entitled “buildings matter too” the top editor resigned amid backlash “‘people over property’ is great as a rhetorical slogan” the inquirer‘s architecture critic inga saffron had written in the piece “but as a practical matter the destruction of downtown buildings in philadelphia — and in minneapolis los angeles and a dozen other american cities — is devastating for the future of cities” bowles’ article essentially explained that saffron was right “while large chains like walmart and best buy have excellent insurance many small businesses that have been burned down since the riots lack similar coverage and for them there is no easy way to replace all that they lost” bowles reported “in kenosha more than 35 small businesses were completely destroyed and around 80 have been damaged according to the city’s business association” she wrote “almost all are locally owned and many are underinsured or struggling to manage” tony farhan owner of a kenosha electronics shop that rioters looted and burned told the new york times that insurance cannot cover his losses farhan his wife and their four sons moved in with his parents while their savings went to one son’s health care he stored “half of my house” in his electronics shop to maximize space rioters looted farhan’s electronics shop on the night after police shot jacob blake they burned down his shop the next night the rioters also looted and burned his brother’s shoe and clothing store next door the apartment units above their stores burned with them as did many other buildings in the workingclass neighborhood of uptown kenosha the tenants survived but several pets died and personal belongings burnt up in the blazes the farhans have insurance though they say it won’t be enough personal items they stashed in the shops were not insured farhan said he does not know how he will replace his children’s winter clothes as temperatures drop “i have no job and i’m using credit cards” farhan said “i’m going into debt and i just got out of debt” in a stunningly candid passage the times reporter admitted that “many on the left decry anyone who criticizes looting arguing that it is a justifiable expression of rage widely quoting out of context the rev dr martin luther king jr that ‘a riot is the language of the unheard” bowles dedicated a great deal of her article to those attacks noting an article from refinery29 claiming “putting the focus on stealing objects from a store during a pandemic no less rather than on the injustice behind the looting the horrific loss of life and racial violence that black folks live with every day is sending teh message that property matters more than people it just demonstrates the way that white supremacy sees more value in a tv set than in the lief of a black man” yet bowles rightly countered that “many of the small businesses in kenosha’s lower and middleincome uptown neighbhorhood will not receive enough in insurance proceeds to fully replace destroyed property and many business owners across kenosha describe the losses in more personal ways” so losing one’s home or one’s business in looting and arson is “personal” who knew “we lived here basically” scott carpenter the owner of bl furniture whose family ran the shop for 40 years told the new york times “it was our home away from home” when the store burned down carpenter lost his livelihood along with a play area with games and old nascar memorabilia he and his father built for local kids even though he had insurance the loss is deeply personal the new york times also found a way to justify reporting on the destruction in social justice terms “one pattern that emerged in the aftermath of the riots in kenosha many whiteowned businesses like mr carpenter’s had better more comprehensive insurance and records than those owned by people of color according to several leaders in the business community” bowles wrote while this anecdote seems to prop up the idea of “institutional racism” bowles did not seem to acknowledge that rioters motivated by fighting “institutional racism” perpetrated serious damage to black and minority communities the destruction disproportionately hit black communities in kenosha wisc minneapolis and chicago the riots destroyed black lives black livelihoods and black monuments at least 26 americans have died in the riots most of them black the new york times has itself propped up the destructive ideology fueling the riots times staffers pressured the paper’s oped editor james bennet to resign for merely agreeing to publish an oped from sen tom cotton rark acknowledging the importance of peaceful protest but calling for law and order against the destructive in september the times published a report suggesting that any violence in the riots came from police and “rightwing activists” over the past year the times has pushed the “1619 project” which originally claimed that the true founding of the united states came with the arrival of the first black slaves in 1619 rather than with the declaration of independence in 1776 in september the times attempted to shove this fact down the memory hole deleting the key text from its interactive website and sending the project’s founder nikole hannahjones on television to claim she never said 1619 was america’s true founding perhaps the paper wished to deepsix this claim because it inspires riots portland activist lilith sinclair provided a chilling example of how claims of “institutional racism” and the marxist critical race theory behind them inspire an aimless revolution “there’s still a lot of work to undo the harm of colonized thought that has been pushed onto black and indigenous communities” she said as examples of “colonized thought” she mentioned christianity and the “gender binary” she said she organizes for “the abolition of … the “united states as we know it” when vandals toppled a statue of george washington in portland they spraypainted “1619” on the statue when claremont’s charles kesler wrote in the new york post “call them the 1619 riots” 1619 project founder nikole hannahjones responded in a sincedeleted tweet that “it would be an honor” to claim responsibility for the destructive riots rep ilhan omar dminn called for the “dismantling” of america’s “economy and political system” in order to root out supposed racist oppression the times was right to finally write about the destruction of the riots but it seems too little too late why did america’s newspaper of record wait until after the election to publish this story perhaps the editors of the new york times feared that reporting these truths would help president donald trump’s reelection after all trump has loudly called for law and order he has denounced marxist critical race theory and the 1619 project a media research center survey suggested that the legacy media and big tech may have thrown the election to democrat joe biden by suppressing the bombshell stories from hunter biden’s laptop in the leadup to election day did the times also skew the election by refusing to report on this

🍿",https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2020/06/hillary_clinton_lost_her_appeal_order_stands_testify_on_private_server_and_benghazi_emails.html,Clatsop,3690,866,amid the chaos and anarchy across bluecity america that exclusively possessed public attention for the last couple of weeks it was not hard to miss any other bit of news — especially if that news has not appeared or been even briefly mentioned by any major mainstream media outlet take for example the news of hillary clinton who lost her appeal in the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit on june 2 where she tried to avoid testifying under oath about her emails and the benghazi case the hearing in the dc circuit came in the case judicial watch v clinton a public records case involving a request for state department documents and communication about the 2012 terror attack at the us mission in benghazi libya us ambassador j christopher stevens and three other americans were killed in the attack the case also involves clintons use of a private email server as secretary of state judicial watch a conservative activist watchdog group that files freedom of information act lawsuits to investigate claimed misconduct by government officials uncovered another 756 pages of emails the fbi was able to retrieve that were part of hillary clintons unsecured server revealing communications between some prominent washington figures and classified emails sent by former prime minister of the united kingdom tony blair the emails were part of the batch clinton tried to delete or destroy judicial watch stated in its press release it showed that clinton had asked blair to continue using her private email after her confirmation and also revealed that blair was sending classified information on her unsecured server clinton had been extremely careless in her handling of classified information as ex–fbi director james comey carefully and rather mildly concluded in july 2016 announcing there would be no charges against her judicial watch did not drop the case on june 2 clintons lawyers challenged a march 2 order from us district judge royce lamberth who ordered clinton to testify p5 the court is not confident that state currently possesses every clinton email recovered by the fbi even years after the fbi investigation the slow trickle of new emails has yet to be explained for this reason the court believes the subpoena would be worthwhile and may even uncover additional previously undisclosed emails accordingly the court grants this request p 10 the court grants judicial watchs request to depose secretary clinton on matters concerning her reasons for using a private server and her understanding of states records management obligations p 10–11 the court holds that secretary clinton and ms mills counselor and chief of staff to hillary clinton during her whole tenure as united states secretary of state cannot be questioned about the underlying actions taken after the benghazi attack but they may be questioned about their knowledge of the existence of any emails documents or text messages related to the benghazi attack such inquiries would go to the adequacy of the search without expanding the parameters…accordingly the court grants in part and denies in part this request clinton had argued that she shouldnt be required to testify because she was a former highlevel government official and that the fbi already tried to retrieve her emails clintons lawyers even mentioned some indisputable right allowing her not to appear in court according to judicial watch tom fitton judicial watch president said clintons lawyers petition practically states that shes too important to have to testify to us shes desperate to stop this questioning by judicial watch because no one has asked her questions like this before we know what the issues are and the court wants specific questions answered but now shes seeking this extraordinary emergency intervention to stop us judicial watch wants to know about the benghazi talking points — when senior obama administration officials knowingly misled the country about what had happened by heavily scrubbing the cias talking points regarding terror references on the eve of the 2012 presidential election they would want to ask her why she deleted 33000 emails from her private server and what information they contained — because despite her claims that they were personal the fbi recovered more than 17000 of them that were workrelated did they contain any classified information did they contain human intel did she know about the upcoming terrorist attack what measures did she use to prevent the benghazi attack what measures did she use to save the american lives and many many more and now despite all the effort to avoid testimony madam secretary will have to answer questions from judicial watch as the dc circuit court of appeals submitted the case which will now be heard on september 9 stock up on

not the victims we need to protect here but st louiss da and ‘the view’ cohosts think the couple 300 agitators terrified on their own front lawn are the problem imagine the tremendous fear one would feel watching as a group of individuals destroyed the wroughtiron gate protecting one’s private community this fear would quickly turn into terror as a mob of black lives matter members 300 strong began to flow through the breach into the neighborhood one’s first reaction would surely be to call the police but what if the police never came this was the situation mark and patricia mccloskey both attorneys were confronted with on the evening of june 28 when the couple saw that several members of this group were armed they called 911 grabbed their legally owned firearms and faced the mob that had trespassed on their property and allegedly threatened to kill them and burn down their home the police never showed up according to st louis’ kmov4 police claim no 911 calls had been received from that street during the time of the incident in the absence of the police protection us citizens have come to expect the mccloskeys armed with a rifle and a pistol were forced to fend for themselves this last friday evening st louis police executed a search warrant at the mccloskey home the police seized the rifle mr mccloskey had held during the encounter and were told that the pistol used by his wife was in the possession of their attorney the federalist’s kylee zempel reported on this story here breaking sources tell five on your side police seized one of the weapons the rifle from the couple and they told police their attorney has the pistol seen in photos httpstcommuwiz7ijs — ksdk news ksdknews july 11 2020 mark mccloskey joined fox news’ tucker carlson on monday night to discuss his situation he told carlson “the rumor is that we are going to be indicted shortly” regarding the police officers who executed the search warrant and confiscated his rifle on friday night mccloskey said the police “unfortunately are stuck between a circuit attorney kim gardner that wants to prosecute us and their own belief that we did nothing wrong” mccloskey explained that “when you have certain elements of society encouraging violence and at the same time asking the police to stand down what’s the only possible result the only possible solution is for individual citizens to stand up to defend themselves and i’m afraid what’s being promoted is causing citizens to stand up and defend themselves so they can be chilled and abused the way we have been” although the use of firearms to protect one’s life and property is the reason our founders included the second amendment in the bill of rights leftists are questioning the couple’s actions saint louis lawyer john amman succinctly sums up their position the homeowners’ actions “could possibly be classified as assault by putting protesters in fear of their safety…people have a right to threaten force if they are threatened however if a group of protesters is walking by a home and not doing anything to the homeowners specifically then they don’t have the right to threaten lethal force without an imminent threat” let’s get this straight amman is concerned that the st louis couple who protected their home after a group of 300 blm members had just broken down an iron gate to enter their private community illegally may have put members of the mob in fear for their safety is he kidding us the woman behind the search warrant is farleft st louis circuit attorney kimberly gardner according to fox news gardner’s 2016 campaign was backed by farleft billionaire george soros gardner was one of four candidates on the primary ballot in the st louis circuit attorney race the st louis postdispatch reported that a new campaign ad had been financed by the safety justice committee sjc a washington dc super pac that was “at least partly funded by” soros the postdispatch noted that the super pac had been “established in june 2016 and reported 30000 in initial funds from soros no other contributors were listed as of its last public filing june 30” on their june 30 quarterly statement gardner’s campaign reported a 6769323 inkind contribution from the super pac further the postdispatch revealed “on july 26 gardner’s campaign reported to the missouri ethics commission a 2454837 inkind donation from the same federal campaign committee a day after reporting a 2573886 contribution from that super pac then on july 29 gardner reported an additional 7277027 from safety justice bringing the sorosbacked super pac total contribution to gardner’s campaign to at least 19075073” these dollar amounts may not sound like much however this was a local race and the sjc contributions “more than doubled gardner’s campaign cash” questioned about the sjc donations gardner emphasized that their mission aligned with hers she said sjc had “reached out and heard my platform and liked what i was saying about building trust they said they’d like to support me and get my message out” the soros connection is relevant because gardner is up for reelection in november making an issue of the mccloskey’s threat of lethal force against a blm group would impress sjc decision makers and could lead to additional financial assistance the day after the june 28 incident gardner’s office issued a statement that read i am alarmed at the events that occurred over the weekend where peaceful protesters were met by guns and a violent assault we must protect the right to peacefully protest and any attempt to chill it through intimidation or threat of deadly force will not be tolerated my office is currently working with the public and the police to investigate these events make no mistake we will not tolerate the use of force against those exercising their first amendment rights and will use the full power of missouri law to hold people accountable incredibly many on the left agree with amman and gardner trying to gain an understanding of how a victim can suddenly become a villain i watched a discussion among the ladies of abc’s “the view” cohost joy behar said there were a lot more questions than answers in this episode “if i were a protestor i wouldn’t appreciate having an ar15 pointed my way or a woman who seemed crazed with her finger on the trigger…they the mccloskeys claim they are blm supporters well in that case why not go out to these supporters and say ‘i appreciate that you’re protesting i agree with you’ acknowledge what they’re doing and lend a hand…neutralize the possibility of violence she had her finger on the trigger this woman” cohost sunny hostin acknowledged that missouri is an opencarry state for firearms but noted “the issue is it would be a crime to brandish a weapon in a threatening manner that is actually a felony” hostin asked if the mccloskeys felt threatened by the protestors why didn’t they stay inside their home and call the police the rest of this discussion can be viewed here sorry ladies but a mob of 300 blm members trespassing through a private neighborhood forfeits their claim to the term “protestors” the remedies behar and hostin suggest are just plain foolish the mccloskeys told reporters that once they noticed two members of the mob were armed they armed themselves and called 911 as mentioned earlier the police never came describing the experience to reporters mark mccloskey said “it was like the storming of the bastille the gate came down and a large crowd of angry aggressive people poured through i was terrified that we’d be murdered within seconds our house would be burned down our pets would be killed” he added “one fellow standing right in front of me pulled out two pistol magazines clicked them together and said ‘you’re next’” police said that when the mccloskeys demanded that the group leave their property they “began yelling obscenities and threats of harm to both victims” last monday night patricia mccloskey told sean hannity “they said that they were going to kill us they were going to come in there they were going to burn down the house they were going to be living in our house after i was dead and they were pointing to different rooms and said ‘that’s going to be my bedroom and that’s going to be the living room and i’m going to be taking a shower in that room’” the blm group members are not the victims we need to protect here the mccloskeys were entirely justified in their actions gardner’s concern over the couple’s threat of force against the “peaceful protestors” is just another politically motivated lie it will likely have the unintended effect of adding to the recent spike in firearm sales situations like this are precisely why americans own guns and must work to

gdbfvw,2020-05-04 16:17:50,Conservative,China 'intentionally concealed the severity' of coronavirus outbreak to hoard supplies: DHS report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/china-intentionally-concealed-the-severity-of-coronavirus-outbreak-to-hoard-supplies-dhs-report,Foubar,3652,361,china downplayed its coronavirus outbreak in order to buy time to hoard medical supplies needed to respond to the pandemic according to intelligence documents a fourpage department of homeland security report dated may 1 and obtained by the associated press on sunday showed that us officials believe chinese leaders “intentionally concealed the severity” of the virus including how contagious it is and how large the countrys outbreak was from the rest of the world in january the report strongly suggested that china did this while knowing how contagious and deadly the coronavirus was during the crucial weeks before it became a global pandemic the dhs analysis indicated that china increased imports of medical supplies and decreased exports while it was hiding the extent of the coronavirus and even attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data the report also stated that china failed to notify the world health organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for most of january so it could purchase medical supplies abroad officials noted that the countrys trade data “shows that china likely stockpiled medical supplies for domestic use before its official notification to the world health organization that covid19 was contagious the intelligence report stated that china increased its imports and decreased its exports of medical supplies beginning in early january during that time the nation increased its imports of surgical face masks by 278 of surgical gowns by 72 and of surgical gloves by 32 according to details from abc news and politico china also decreased its exports of medical supplies at the same time including 45 fewer ventilators 56 fewer intubator kits 53 fewer thermometers 58 fewer cotton balls and swabs 48 fewer surgical gloves 71 fewer surgical gowns and 48 fewer surgical face masks the conclusions of the report were based on a 95 chance that china’s changes in imports and export behavior were not within the normal range china has faced criticism from president trump lawmakers and public health experts for its coronavirus response and for failing to alert the world of the virus when it was first identified in wuhan late last year white house trade adviser peter navarro claimed last month that the country spent six weeks concealing the virus from the who while cornering the personal protective equipment market “during that period of time that sixweek interval when they were hiding this virus from the world china went from a net exporter of personal protective equipment they are the largest producer of that in the world to a large net importer” he said “they basically went around and vacuumed up virtually all of the ppe around the world and what that did was leave people in new york milan and everywhere inbetween defenseless when it came time to have that ppe” secretary of state mike pompeo confirmed elements of the dhs report on sunday during an interview with martha raddatz on this week on abc i want to turn to china with intelligence officials saying that the chinese government intentionally concealed the severity of covid19 from the international community in early january while it stockpiled medical supplies in terms of international concealing i assume you think they did that intentionally to keep as many masks for themselves as possible raddatz said will there be some sort of retaliation pompeo replied that youve got the facts just about right and we can confirm that the chinese communist party did all that it could to make sure that the world didnt learn in a timely fashion about what was taking place theres lots of evidence of that it’s the way communist parties operate he continued this is a classic communist disinformation effort that created enormous risk and now you can see hundreds of thousands of people around the world tens of thousands in the united states have been harmed president trump is very clear were going to hold those responsible accountable and well do so on a timeline that is our own trump has speculated that china may have unleashed the coronavirus due to a “mistake and said he has seen evidence to give him a high degree of confidence that the coronavirus originated in a wuhan laboratory pompeo said sunday there is enormous evidence connecting the coronavirus to the wuhan institute of virology a senior intelligence official told the washington examiner that a majority of the us intelligence communitys 17 spy agencies believe covid19 originated through an accidental escape from the lab as of sunday the world had seen nearly 3500000 cases of the covid19 virus and more than 246000 related deaths

white supremacists” describing the rightwing group’s beliefs as “western chauvinist” and noting that their international chairman enrique tarrio is black “gotta say the proud boys aren’t white supremacists” tweeted mr reilly author of “hate crime hoax” the proud boys came under the microscope after president trump refused during tuesday’s presidential debate to condemn them as white supremacists saying “proud boys — stand back and stand by” prompting accusations that he was supporting virulent racists mr reilly said that about 10 to 20 of proud boys activists are people of color a diverse racial composition that is “extremely wellknown in law enforcement” based on his research “enrique tarrio their overall leader is a black cuban dude the proud boys explicitly say they’re not racist” mr reilly told the washington times “they are an openly rightleaning group and they’ll openly fight you — they don’t deny any of this — but saying they’re white supremacist if you’re talking about a group of people more than 10 people of color and headed by an afrolatino guy that doesn’t make sense” senate minority leader charles e schumer accused mr trump of refusing to condemn white supremacy tweeting “he told white supremacists to ‘stand back and stand by’ president trump is a national disgrace and americans will not stand for it” democratic presidential nominee joseph r biden told reporters wednesday “my message to the proud boys and every other white supremacist group is cease and desist that’s not who we are” white house spokeswoman alysa farah pushed back on the criticism saying “i don’t think there’s anything to clarify he’s told them to stand back” black trump supporter melissa tate also challenged the “white supremacist” label posting a video in which she and beverly beatty said that the proud boys helped provide security for them at a christian prayer event “stop the lies” tweeted ms tate who has 440700 followers “proud boys are not white supremacist they are christian men many of them hispanic some black” added michael burkes who has 236700 followers on his “trump‘s black grandson” account “the proud boys aren’t the ones calling me a ‘coon’ so

lawsuit last week against the proud boys alleging that four counterprotesters were injured by proud boys activists wielding paintball guns and bear mace during an aug 22 melee in portland “the proud boys represent an unconventional strain of american rightwing extremism” said the antidefamation league on its website “while the group can be described as violent nationalistic islamophobic transphobic and misogynistic its members represent a range of ethnic backgrounds and its leaders vehemently protest any allegations of racism” mr mcinnes who left the group in 2018 has been banned from most socialmedia platforms for his antisemitic statements including a video called “ten things i hate about jews” which he later changed to “ten things i hate about israel” supporters of the proud boys include rightwing pundits ann coulter and michelle malkin as well as former republican consultant and convicted felon roger stone whose 2019 sentence was later commuted by mr trump during the tuesday debate moderated by fox news host chris wallace mr trump was asked if he would be willing to tell white supremacists and militia groups to “stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities” referring to the ongoing protests and rioting “sure i’m willing to but i would say almost everything i see is from the left wing not from the right wing” mr trump said “i’m willing to do anything i want to see peace” mr wallace said “then do it sir” mr trump said him to “give me a name” and mr biden said “proud boys” “proud boys — stand back and stand by” mr trump said “but i’ll tell you what i’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a rightwing problem” he challenged mr biden to condemn antifa to which mr biden replied “antifa is an idea not an organization” mr trump replied “oh you’ve got to be kidding” blexit founder candace owens asked why mr biden was not asked to condemn antifa tweeting “unbelievable every person in america knows these riots are being orchestrated by black lives matter and antifa” “chris wallace asks the president to condemn white supremacists but did not think to ask joe biden to

should not share data that runs afoul of its support of blm protests michigan state university leaders have successfully pressured stephen hsu to resign from his position as vice president of research and innovation after the graduate employees union launched a campaign to oust him from his role this came after the union which represents teaching and research assistants crawled through years of blog posts and interviews hsu had conducted and criticized him for sharing content on genetic differences among different races but the main thrust to oust hsu came because the professor touted michigan state research that found police are not more likely to shoot africanamericans “the victory of the twitter mob will likely have a chilling effect on academic freedom on campus” hsu told the college fix via email the union had taken advantage of a black lives matterlinked shutdownstem day on june 10 to help oust him hsu stepped down from his vice president role on june 19 after pressure from the union and the president of the university samuel stanley hsu will stay on as a physics professor at michigan state however today for shutdownacademia shutdownstem the geu and its coalition partners in the stem community are calling for the removal of stephen hsu as vp of research and graduate studies at michiganstateu — michigan state geu gradempunion june 10 2020 the union also circulated a petition against hsu that accused him of “scientific racism” that garnered over 800 signers an open letter signed by more than 500 faculty and staff at michigan state argued hsu supports the idea that intelligence is linked to genetics a counterpetition in support of hsu has gained more than 1000 signers including many fellow professors from across the country “to remove hsu for holding controversial views or for inquiring about controversial topics or for simply talking to controversial personalities … would also set a dangerous precedent inconsistent with the fundamental principles of modern enlightened higher education” it read as for the claim of “scientific racism” hsu rejected that on his personal website stating “i believe that basic human rights and human dignity derive from our shared humanity not from uniformity in ability or genetic makeup” but a leader with the graduate student union said that there were multiple factors that led to hsu’s removal including people who disagreed with hsu not feeling they were able to state their concerns for fear of backlash “once we started the dialogue dozens of people approached us with personal stories of their own attempts to speak out and their own experiences with hsu and hundreds signed on calling for his removal” graduate employees union vice president acacia ackles told the college fix the union has also criticized hsu’s promotion of a study that found there is no racial bias in police shootings “we found that the race of the officer doesn’t matter when it comes to predicting whether black or white citizens are shot” according to the michigan statebased research hsu had quoted that drew the ire of many hsu said that the attacks against him are baseless “the geu alleged that i am a racist because i interviewed msu psychology professor joe cesario who studies police shootings” he wrote in an email to the college fix “but cesario’s work along with similar work by others such as roland fryer at harvard is essential to understanding deadly force and how to improve policing” cesario is the michigan state psychology professor who coauthored the study published july 2019 that debunked the notion that police are more likely to shoot africanamericans hsu wrote on his blog that the paper concluded “there is no widespread racial bias in police shooting” professor cesario received a small amount of funding for his research under hsu’s leadership cesario pointed out to the wall street journal “we had no idea what the data was going to be what the outcome was going to be before we did this study” cesario’s research had been cited in a widely shared wall street journal oped headlined “the myth of systemic police racism” that was published june 3 amid racially charged protests against the death of george floyd in police custody the “msu communications team highlighted the mention in the june 9 edition of their email newsletter insidemsu the next day the graduate employees union denounced mr hsu by june 11 editors of the newsletter had apologized ‘for including the item and for the harm it caused’” the journal reports the graduate union told the fix that administrators should not share research that runs counter to public statements by the university “it is the union’s position that an administrator sharing such views is in opposition to msu’s statements released supporting the protests and their root cause and aim” ackles wrote in an email to the college fix president stanley released a statement on june 19 where he defended his decision to pressure hsu to resign “i believe this is what is best for our university to continue our progress forward the exchange of ideas is essential to higher education and i fully support our faculty and their academic freedom to address the most difficult and controversial issues” “but when senior administrators at msu choose to speak out on any issue they are viewed as speaking for the university as a whole their

fw9nk2,2020-04-07 02:39:27,Conservative,Rose McGowan Calls Alyssa Milano A #MeToo Fraud For Supporting Joe Biden After Sexual Assault Allegation,https://www.dailywire.com/news/rose-mcgowan-calls-alyssa-milano-a-metoo-fraud-for-supporting-joe-biden-after-sexual-assault-allegation,Foubar,3611,637,actress and prominent metoo activist rose mcgowan had some harsh words for fellow activist and actress alyssa milano after the latter said she was still endorsing former vice president joe biden despite sexual assault allegations against him “you are a fraud” mcgowan began “this is about holding the media accountable you go after trump kavanaugh saying believe victims you are a lie you have always been a lie the corrupt dnc is in on the smear job of tara reade so are you shame” you are a fraud this is about holding the media accountable you go after trump kavanaugh saying believe victims you are a lie you have always been a lie the corrupt dnc is in on the smear job of tara reade so are you shame httpstcob7nhk4k09k — rose mcgowan rosemcgowan april 6 2020 as the daily wire reported milano tweeted a youtube clip of her appearance on andy cohen’s siriusxm radio show explaining why she has remained silent after biden was accused of decadesold sexual assault by a former staffer named tara reade “i have not publicly said anything about this – if you’ll remember it took me a long time to say anything about harvey weinstein as well – because i believe that even though we should believe women and that is an important thing … what that statement really means is that like you know for so long the goto has been not to believe them so really we have to sort of societally change that mindset to believing women but that does not mean at the expense of not giving men their due process and investigating situations and it’s gotta be fair in both directions” milano said this is a far cry different than what milano has said and how she has acted in other situations when she condemned president donald trump and supreme court justice brett kavanaugh after they were accused of sexual assault without any investigation whatsoever “so you know i’ve been very vocal about biden and my support for him i’ve known him for a long time and i did do my due diligence” she said saying part of the reason she questioned the accusations was an article about how metoo legal fund time’s up refused to take reade’s case even though they said their reason was due to their classification as a nonprofit and not anything to do with whether they believed reade “i just don’t feel comfortable throwing away a decent man that i’ve known for 15 years in this time of complete chaos without there being a thorough investigation i’m sure that the mainstream media would be jumping all over this as well if they found more evidence through their investigating” host andy jumped in to suggest the mainstream media would be all over the story if we weren’t in the middle of a pandemic and if there were more “credible” evidence this is not true however as the media rushed to report every accusation against kavanaugh even when the evidence was nonexistent christine blasey ford said kavanaugh attacked her when they were in high school three decades earlier but there isn’t one iota of evidence the two were ever in the same room together kavanaugh’s second accuser deborah ramirez didn’t even know if kavanaugh was the man who assaulted her until after she talked to democrat lawyers the third accuser julie swetnick was interviewed on tv even though nbc knew her story wasn’t credible milano then took a strange turn – for her and other metoo champions – by seriously suggesting we remember due process “i sent the metoo tweet over two years ago i never thought that it would be something that was going to destroy innocent men we don’t want that to happen either” she said “so we have to find this balance in the ‘believe women’ movement and also giving men their due process and realizing that we’re destroying lives if we publicly don’t go through the right steps in order to find out if an accusation is credible or not” anyone with half a brain could have foreseen innocent men getting swept up when we’re told no women would ever lie about being raped even though there is amble historical evidence and milano only cares now because it is someone she likes who is being accused perhaps that will open her eyes to the problem of “believe all women” but she’ll probably forget about due process as soon as another republican is accused

for calling in officers after previously stating that most 911 calls are unnecessary and her being one of the citys main advocates of a 18million cut to the police department yet during a city council

during an end domestic terrorism protest in portland in 2019 the run in with lyft driver richmond frost happened on november 1 when hardesty was allegedly angered after he refused to roll the windows up despite it being recommended policy from the company to keep them down due to the coronavirus it followed annoyance over a mixup about where she was being picked up all culminating in the driver cancelling the ride and dropping hardesty at a gas station saying she could find another car hardesty refused to leave the vehicle and called the cops telling them that she would not leave until the driver had found her another ride frost also made a 911 call and officers were forced to arrive at the gas station shortly before 10pm in spite of the fact that hardesty has argued that many 911 calls are unnecessary and a police response often not needed according to the portland tribune the commissioner acquired another car home with half an hour of her first ride being canceled this is another example of being black in america and being put in a position where i have to be the one to look out for my personal safety hardesty claimed during thursdays meeting as she addressed the media attention the incident had received i didnt expect the lyft driver to do it certainly didnt expect the police to do it it was my responsibility to make sure i got home safe hardesty added when youre living in a city where white supremacists are proudly riding around in their big trucks with their flags and youre a black person and somebody wants to put you on the side of the road at night not gonna happen the proud boys an altright group faces off against black lives matters protesters in portland in august hardesty said that their presence in the city made her afraid to be alone at night

portlands 911 system had been picked up from ilani casino in washington when the series of disagreements began frost 63 pulled into a gas station and told hardesty to leave but she refused as it was cold and she was a woman and alone according to fox news audio of both the 911 calls were published by oregon live revealing their versions of events well ive got a lyft driver that decided he would just drop me off at a filling station well im not getting out of the car in the dark at a filling station not happening all because i asked him to put the window up im not leaving hardesty told the 911 operator i am not going to allow him to leave me on the side of the road i paid for a ride and he says he canceled it so im just going to sit here until he sends me another ride she is told by the dispatcher that technically its his property and theres no crimes involved only you can order another ride the dispatcher said according to koin 6 i can have an officer come out but theyre not going to be able to make him stay there he cant go anywhere because im not moving until another car comes hardesty insists and the dispatcher says they will send an officer in frosts call made three minutes after hardesty he is heard saying ive got a customer that i canceled the ride im a rideshare driver and i canceled the ride and ive taken her off the freeway to this filling station so that she can order another ride i canceled the ride so shes no longer involved or engaged with me shes refusing to get out of my car he added explaining that she was in the back seat and he was in the front when asked if she could have any weapons on her he replied i doubt it hardesty said that she made the call because she felt unsafe in the situation and accused front of being so blatantly rude from the beginning i dont call 911 lightly but i certainly am not going to do anything that would put my personal safety at risk she told the portland tribune i knew that having him call the police would but me in danger and thats why i proactively called 911 its a lot harder when you are black or brown in america to make that decision but i ultimately had very limited options she added portland commissioner jo ann hardesty claimed she called 911 as she feared for her safety frost also admitted that there was tension from the start and told the portland tribune that he wasnt sure if maybe hardesty had a bad day gambling i spent 40 years in the service business he said theres always a few people you cannot please them no matter what you do he added that he felt the call was so unnecessary … to argue and belittle and to treat me the way i felt she treated me was completely unnecessary frost also argued that the gas station was well lit that she was safe and that he had explained to her that he couldnt call a lyft for her yet hardesty countered that the station was about to close which was confirmed to kino 6 by an employee which would mean the lights were about to be turned off i didnt know how long i would have to wait she said there was no way i was going to get out on the side of the road in the dark because some driver has an attitude and decided i should just get out and just whatever happens happens hardesty had a new ride by 1014pm but immediately made a complaint to lyft i requested a ride the driver came to the wrong pick up location he then blamed me i asked him to roll the window up on my side and he started to yell i cant because the regulations require each window to be cracked which isnt true said the complaint which was released by her office he then pulls over in the dark on the side of a gas station and told me he was cancelling the ride i had no interest in being left on the side of the road by an angry driver he threatens to call the police i called the police another car both arrived at the same time it is totally inappropriate to expect a woman to get out of a vehicle in the dead of night because any angry person demands it this is a safety issue for your customer your driver was in no danger lyft responded by stating that the driver had acted in accordance to their policy the feedback alleged that you refused to exit the drivers vehicle after they requested you do so as a reminder drivers are free to end a ride for any reason as long as the drop off is in a safe location it said hardesty calls for massive changes and 18million in cuts to portlands police department safety is our top priority we take these matters very seriously we encourage everyone using lyft to be respectful of others this helps maintain a safe and inclusive community please know that future reports of this nature may lead to additional action being taken on your account the reports of hardestys 911 emerged just days after she called on elected leaders in portland to move past the fear and stretch ourselves to take the action that is demanded regarding a new police budget she has been pushing to reallocate 18 million from the portland police bureau to reinvest in community covid19 relief and police alternatives but the amendment was not passed by the portland city council last week in a lengthy statement posted to twitter when the amendment failed to be passed she said what we have right now does not work you cannot look me in the eye and tell me that a bureau responding violently to protesters every night works for us or that over 50 of all the bureaus arrestees are houseless individuals works for us or that a bureau shown to stop black drivers twice as much as white drivers works for us or a bureau that has accumulated over 6000000 in overtime works for us in june we started this journey by reallocating 15 million from the police bureau and redirecting those funds towards community investments she added we came into this budget with the same goal of investing in our communities and reducing police by providing mutual aid because if portlanders cant depend on portland to keep them safe and supported who can they count on
