legally took 750000 meant to feed inmates bought beach house enlarge this image toggle caption brynn andersonap brynn andersonap a sheriff in alabama took home as personal profit more than 750000 that was budgeted to feed jail inmates — and then purchased a 740000 beach house a reporter at the birmingham news found and its perfectly legal in alabama according to state law and local officials alabama has a depressionera law that allows sheriffs to keep and retain unspent money from jail foodprovision accounts sheriffs across the state take excess money as personal income — and in the event of a shortfall are personally liable for covering the gap etowah county sheriff todd entrekin told the news that he follows that practice of taking extra money from the fund saying the law says its a personal account and thats the way ive always done it sheriffs across the state do the same thing and have for decades but the scale of the practice is not clear it is presently unknown how much money sheriffs across the state have taken because most do not report it as income on state financial disclosure forms the southern center for human rights wrote in january but in etowah county the news found the paper trail following the letter of the law the news discovered the eyepopping figures on ethics disclosures that entrekin sent to the state over the course of three years he received more than 750000 in extra compensation from food provisions the exact amount over 750000 is unclear because entrekin was not required to specify above a 250000 a year threshold the paper writes the paper also found that entrekin and his wife own several properties worth a combined 17 million including a 740000 fourbedroom house in orange beach ala purchased in september without the provision funds entrekin earns a little more than 93000 a year the paper says in a statement emailed to npr entrekin said the liberal media has began attacking me for following the letter of the law from the archives 2009 ala sheriff jailed for starving inmates ala sherriff jailed for starving inmates listen the food bill is a controversial issue thats used every election cycle to attack the sheriffs office entrekin said alabama law is clear regarding my personal financial responsibilities of feeding inmates until the legislature acts otherwise the sheriff must follow the current law before he made headlines for profiting off the law entrekin was better known for being indebted by it when entrekins predecessor died while still in office all the money in the food provision account went to his estate — as state law dictated a county official told npr entrekin had to borrow 150000 to keep the inmates fed he was paying down that debt for years the gadsden times reported in 2009 while he was still in debt from paying for inmates food entrekin told the times that he personally thought the law needed to be changed but he noted that it might cost more money for taxpayers if the county commission had to manage jail kitchens through an open bid process david akins the chief administrative officer of the etowah county commission agrees with that assessment he says the commission is not eager to take on that duty as some other local governments have done the sheriff can feed inmates cheaper than the county can he said inmates diets sheriffs responsibility alabamas controversial system hearkens back to a different era when county jails were more of a mom and pop operation and feeding inmates was often the responsibility of a sheriffs wife today in alabama sheriffs are personally responsible for feeding inmates in their jails and receive funds to cover the cost for state inmates its less than 2 per inmate per day for county city or federal inmates the amount can be higher if sheriffs feed inmates on less than that they can keep and retain whatever is left over lawyer aaron littman at the southern center for human rights said in a january statement that the practice of pocketing leftover funds was a dubious interpretation of the law that raises grave ethical concerns invites public corruption and creates a perverse incentive to spend as little as possible on feeding people who are in jail he argues the sheriffs are supposed to manage the funds not personally profit from them but local governments across the state say the law is clear that the money can be kept for personal use thats the way it was set up years ago akins from the etowah county commission tells npr thats just the way its been in the state of course state legislators could always change that if they wanted to he doesnt see a problem with the practice i think if the inmates were not being fed properly it might be a concern he said but ill guarantee you that if theyre not fed properly the federal government would let us know about it sheriff corn dog and bankrupt car lots in some cases the federal government has objected in 2009 thensheriff greg bartlett of morgan county was briefly tossed in jail after acknowledging that he had personally profited to the tune of 212000 from a surplus in the jailfood account prisoners testified about receiving meager meals to cut corners bartlett used charitable donations and special deals as cbs put it — including once splitting a 1000 truck full of corn dogs with a sheriff of a nearby county and then feeding the inmates corn dogs twice a day for weeks he defended himself by noting that his profit was legal under state law but an exasperated federal judge said the sheriff had an obligation to feed his inmates adequate food the story made national headlines and bartlett agreed to no longer dip into the jail food fund newstime alabama sheriff legally took 750000 meant to feed inmates bought beach house 510 in 2015 a sheriff in morgan county loaned 150000 from the inmate food fund to a corrupt car lot the loan was revealed when the business facing theft and scam charges went bankrupt again that sheriffs use of the food money was legal under state law it was only prohibited in morgan county because of the countys particular history aside from individual lawsuits like those its hard to tell exactly how much money earmarked for inmate food is going to sheriffs this january two advocacy groups sued for access to records that could reveal how much jail food money was being turned into personal profit the groups

fabled sense of security encapsulated by ronald reagans morning in america reelection ad america is not at ease with itself and its putting the rest of the world on edge there have been more dangerous and polarized moments in american history but its tough to recall a time when political discourse was so mean and so dispiriting this week the white house could not bring itself to condemn a racist attack by roseanne barr one of trumps most vocal supporters comedienne samantha bee did say sorry but only after calling the presidents daughter ivanka a feckless c in what was just the latest explosion of angry and divisive rhetoric that punctuates most days in the trump era with the economy roaring things ought to feel more comfortable but in a turbulent time kids now talk openly about

a special counsel is burrowing deep into a young presidency trumps own revolt against the boundaries of his power has the country perpetually on the cusp of a constitutional crisis we are seeing a culture begin to seriously erode for our children and our grandchildren it is happening ohio republican gov john kasich said on cnn this week who is to blame the biggest question in politics is how much is trump responsible for the distemper well he didnt invent political divisions and bareknuckle politics presidents with the possible exception of george washington have cursed for eons and politics has never been for the easily offended after all an opponent once called former vice president john nance garner a labor baiting poker playing whiskeydrinking evil old man but the vitriol is constant these days insults and controversies erupt every hour many critics believe hes abandoned the notion that presidents should offer a moral lead and trumps winnerloser life calculus explains why hes ignored americans who didnt vote for him his presidency functions in a riptide of chaos and acrimony in fact its bewildering pace and emotive whirl may be what it needs to survive its existential purpose is tearing at societal racial and cultural fault lines to ensure its foundation is replenished by outrage and anger from trumps ever loyal base his relentless churn leaves no time for reflection or connecting the dots of a noxious political environment and anger begets anger trumps opponents start to adopt his own unchained rhetoric often on twitter and barriers of decorum and decency are overwhelmed yet for trumps supporters the disruption and shattered norms and outrage among establishment power centers in politics and the media in washington is proof that he is doing exactly what they hoped he would do for them the old system and ways of behavior were so corrupt dysfunctional and distant that just tearing them down is enough in many ways trump inherited a political environment ripe for exploitation after two decades of turmoil social media the balkanization of the news industry into ideological fragments and gerrymandered congressional districts are often blamed for the bitter political tone a financial crisis a decade ago left deep economic dislocation and though jobless numbers and housing markets have recovered many americans are still worse off and hurting mechanization is ravaging traditional industry and an opioid crisis is scarring the heartland twice in the last 20 years on sept 11 2001 and with russias meddling in the last presidential election americas enemies have exploited its freedoms to attack it igniting furious debates about us institutions and values that scorched national unity all of this is the backdrop to trumps surge to power in 2016 when he turned bitterness at a political system that had no answers for many americans into a populist crusade at the time many trump supporters saw his vulgarity as proof he was an authentic scourge of the establishment but in office hes worsened national dislocation by making lying and the peddling of conspiracy theories a central political strategy his presidency is rooted in an assault on the institutions like the justice department and the fbi that underpin american public life and hes turned on americas friends abroad launching trade wars with europe and canada bad for the country this week trump in his escalating effort to discredit the special counsel probe accused robert mueller of plotting to meddle in the midterm elections it was a move that threatened to cast doubt on the integrity of the polls and for his supporters the result should democrats win a source familiar with discussions inside trumps legal team told cnns jim acosta this week that the president would sharpen the attacks heading into the fall elections thats bad for the country the source said adding that its likely to get worse trumps constant barrages may actually also be depriving him of some of the credit he is entitled to claim for the healthy economy in the latest cnnssrs poll trump was at 41 and it stands to reason that his disruptive normbusting behavior is largely to blame still gallups famous poll of national mood has 37 of americans satisfied with the direction of the country the highest level since early august 2005 however 62 are dissatisfied given the depth of current political divides and the hankering of democrats who want revenge for 2016 as well as trumps determination to ignite the anger of his base it seems unlikely the political fury will end soon at the end of another tumultuous political year 1968 which was characterized by assassinations and social unrest that makes 2018 look tame the nation united in awe as the astronauts of apollo 8 beamed back stunning photos of earth humanitys common home after beating the soviets to become the first men to orbit the moon with the space program in hiatus its tough to imagine another event that could ease todays political tempest and unite americans in the same way the moment when thensen barack obama of illinois vowed there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america seems far more than 14 years ago in his new book the world as it is obama confidant and speechwriter ben rhodes says his boss wondered after trumps victory whether his vision of a politics freed of its tribal divides had been wrong or premature sometimes i wonder whether i was 10 or 20 years too early rhodes quotes obama as saying many conservatives differ with the idea that the 44th president was a conciliator or a unifying force but someday probably decades hence perhaps some other politician of either party might risk a campaign based on the idea that americans are more united than divided another leader soon to exit the stage john mccain is also pining for a time when political acrimony was less intense before i leave id like to see our politics begin to return to the purposes and practices that distinguish our history from the history of other nations the ailing senator from arizona writes in his new book the

That means America is simultaneously the most expensive and one of the riskiest industrialized nations in which to have children.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/why-does-it-cost-32093-just-to-give-birth-in-america,User0989,22495,5277,the us is the most expensive nation in the world in which to have a baby – and it may factor into thousands of bankruptcies each year stella apo osaetwum and her husband did everything by the book they went to a hospital covered by insurance saw an obstetrician in their plan but when her three sons – triplets – were born prematurely bills started rolling in the hospital charged her family 877000 in total “when the bills started coming to be very honest i was an emotional wreck” said apo osaetwum “and this is in the midst of trying to take care of three babies who were premature” america is the most expensive nation in the world to give birth when things go wrong – from preeclampsia to premature birth – costs can quickly spiral into the hundreds of thousands of dollars while the data is limited experts in medical debt say the costs of childbirth factor into thousands of family bankruptcies in america each year it’s nearly impossible to put a price tag on giving birth in america since costs vary dramatically by state and hospital but one 2013 study by the the advocacy group childbirth connection found that on average hospitals charged 32093 for an uncomplicated vaginal birth and newborn care and 51125 for a standard caesarean section and newborn care insurance typically covers a large chunk of those costs but families are still often on the hook for thousands of dollars another estimate from the international federation of health plans put the average amount insurers paid for a vaginal birth in the us at 10808 in 2015 that is quintuple the ifhp estimate for another industrialized nation spain where it costs 1950 to deliver a child the amount insurers pay for births in america is lower than the amount billed by hospitals because insurers negotiate lower prices even the luxurious accommodations provided to the duchess of cambridge for the birth of the royal family’s daughter princess charlotte – believed to have cost up to 18000 – were cheaper than many births in america despite these high costs the us consistently ranks poorly in health outcomes for mothers and infants the us rate of infant mortality is 61 for every 1000 live births higher than slovakia and hungary and nearly three times the rate of japan and finland the us also has the worst rate of maternal mortality in the developed world that means america is simultaneously the most expensive and one of the riskiest industrialized nations in which to have children american families rarely shoulder the full costs of childbirth on their own – but still pay far more than in other industrialized nations nearly half of american mothers are covered by medicaid a program available to low income households that covers nearly all birth costs but people with private insurance still regularly pay thousands of dollars in copays deductibles and partially reimbursed services when they give birth childbirth connection put the average out of pocket childbirth costs for mothers with insurance at 3400 in 2013 in apo osaetwum’s case private insurance covered most of the 877000 bill but her family was responsible for 51000 apo osaetwum was the victim of what is called “surprise billing” in these cases patients have no way of knowing whether an ambulance company emergency room physician anesthesiologist – or in her case a halfdozen neonatologists – are members of the patient’s insurance plan even though apo osaetwum went to a hospital covered by her insurance none of the neonatologists who attended to her sons were “innetwork” therefore the insurance reimbursed far less of their bills qa did you receive an unexpected or unmanageable bill after giving birth show hide we want to tell stories of women who received unexpected or unmanageable bills after giving birth if this affects you you can tell us about it using our encrypted form your stories will help our journalists and we will use some of them in our reporting there are few studies that estimate the number of families who go bankrupt from this type of unexpected expense one of the best estimates is now outdated – conducted 10 years ago but one of the authors of that research dr steffie woolhandler estimates as many as 56000 families each year still go bankrupt from adding a new family member through birth or adoption “why any society should let anyone be bankrupted by medical bills is beyond me frankly” said woolhandler “it just doesn’t happen in other western democracies” since woolhandler conducted that research in 2007 20 million americans gained health insurance through the affordable care act health reform law and consumer protections were added for pregnant women but republicans and the trump administration have pledged to repeal these consumer protections “people face a double whammy when they’re faced with a medical condition” said woolhandler bankruptcy is often “the combined effect of medical bills and the need to take time off work” there is no nationwide law that provides paid family leave in the us meaning most families forgo income to have a child theres proof electing women radically improves life for mothers and families read more and although childbirth is one of the most common hospital procedures in the nation prices are completely opaque that means americans don’t know how much a birth will cost in advance dr renee hsia an emergency department physician at the university of california san francisco and a health policy expert likened

debt'",https://theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/26/trump-puerto-rico-crisis-massive-debt,,17362,4340,donald trump will visit puerto rico next tuesday to see some of the devastation wrought by hurricane maria on the lives of 35 million americans as the president announced the visit however one democratic congresswoman who was born in puerto rico warned that his lack of attention to the disaster so far risked making it “your katrina” puerto rico after hurricane maria – in pictures read more the white house said on tuesday trump had also made additional disaster assistance available “by authorizing an increase in the level of federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures” but it took the president five full days to respond to the plight of the us territory when he finally did so on monday night his comments on twitter were so devoid of empathy it threatened to spark new controversy hot on the heels of the billowing dispute he singlehandedly provoked over african american sporting figures protesting against racial inequality during the national anthem trump effectively blamed the islanders – all of whom are american citizens – for their own misfortune “texas florida are doing great but puerto rico which was already suffering from broken infrastructure massive debt is in deep trouble” trump wrote the us territory was hit by maria soon after the two states were struck by harvey and irma trump acknowledged that “much of the island was destroyed” but caustically went on to say that its electrical grid was already “in terrible shape” and that puerto rico owed billions of dollars to wall street and the banks “which sadly must be dealt with” the following morning the president spoke to reporters at the white house before a bipartisan meeting on tax reform next tuesday would he said be the earliest feasible day to visit the island due to the extent of the damage the island has been “literally destroyed” trump said expressing confidence “they’ll be back” the people of puerto rico “are important to all of us” he said federal authorities were landing relief supplies “on an hourly basis” trump said adding that he will also stop in the us virgin islands also severely damaged later at a press conference in the white house rose garden he denied that he had been preoccupied with the nfl issue insisting that the government has had “tremendous reviews” for its response which now includes the military “we understand it’s a disaster it’s a disaster that just happened” he told reporters “the grid was in bad shape before the storm and puerto rico didn’t get hit by one hurricane it got hit by two hurricanes and they were among the biggest we’ve ever seen “we are unloading on an hourly basis massive loads of water and food and supplies for puerto rico and this isn’t like florida where we can go right up the spine or texas where we go right down the middle and distribute this is a thing called the atlantic ocean this is tough stuff the governor has been so incredible in his statements about the job we’re doing we’re doing a great job” trump added for emphasis “everybody has said it’s amazing the job we’ve done in puerto rico we’re very proud of it and i’m going there on tuesday” trump’s monday night tweets were the first comments he had made on puerto rico since hours before maria made landfall as a category 4 hurricane pummelling the island and destroying its entire power network with winds up to 155mph 250kmh on that occasion he told the people of puerto rico “we are with you” but for many puerto ricans the reality five days after the hurricane struck was that the us president had not been with them about 700 federal emergency management agency fema staff were on the island in a total of 10000 federal workers carrying out search and rescue missions and supplying basic food and water but trump spent those five days mired in his selfmade battle with african american sports stars seemingly oblivious to the plight of millions of hispanic americans in peril in a natural disaster zone “at the same time that he was doing all of that we had american citizens in puerto rico who are in a desperate condition” said hillary clinton trump’s defeated opponent in the 2016 election in a radio interview which aired before trump’s latenight tweets on monday “he has not said one word about them about other american citizens in the us virgin islands i’m not sure he knows that puerto ricans are american citizens” the trump administration has refused to waive federal restrictions on foreign ships carrying lifesaving supplies to puerto rico – a concession it readily made for texas and florida in the cases of hurricanes harvey and irma in the last of his tweets on monday night trump said “food water and medical are top priorities – and doing well” on tuesday morning while continuing to tweet about the nfl he wrote “thank you to carmen yulin cruz the mayor of san juan for your kind words on fema etc we are working hard much food and water thereon way” facebook twitter pinterest members of fema’s urban search and rescue team conduct a search operation in yauco puerto

earlier on monday rosselló made a point of thanking george hw bush and former florida governor jeb bush for their calls of support most puerto ricans were spared the experience of reading trump’s tweets as a result of the total blackout but condemnation was swift in mainland us juliette kayyem a former senior official in the department of homeland security under barack obama said trump’s response showed “a lack of empathy of epic proportions” on tuesday nydia velázquez a democratic representative from new york said she was concerned that trump’s continued tweets about nfl players showed he did not grasp the severity of the crisis referring to criticism of george w bush following a hurricane that devastated new orleans in 2005 she warned the president “if you don’t take this crisis seriously this is going to be your katrina” velázquez also said she was “offended and insulted” by trump’s tweet that puerto rico’s public debt contributed to the crisis joe crowley another new york democrat said it was “absolutely ridiculous” for trump to mention debt “when people are suffering and dying” “here’s a president who’s used bankruptcy throughout his entire career” he said • this
