cover the cost of protecting president trump and his family through the end of september but after that the agency will hit a federally mandated cap on salaries and overtime unless congress intervenes if lawmakers don’t lift the cap about a third of the agency’s agents would be working overtime without being paid agency officials said “the secret service estimates that roughly 1100 employees will work overtime hours in excess of statutory pay caps during calendar year 2017” director randolph “tex” alles said in a statement “to remedy this ongoing and serious problem the agency has worked closely with the department of homeland security the administration and the congress over the past several months to find a legislative solution” the spending limits are supposed to last through december but the cost of protecting the president and members of the extended first family who have traveled extensively for business and vacations has strained the secret service local governments and at least one other federal agency the coast guard presidential travel for trump and the first lady — who fly to their oceanfront maralago club in palm beach fla and to their golf club in bedminster nj on many weekends — has added costs for taxpayers and complications for the government the secret service also must provide protection for trump’s four adult children countless scandals and 3200 special agents in the agencys nearly 150year history heres a look at the secret service by the numbers the washington post alles cited overall increases to his agency’s staff levels which grew by 800 this year as a factor driving the extra costs calling the issue “not one that can be attributed to the current administration’s protection requirements alone” trump family’s elaborate lifestyle a ‘logistical nightmare’ at taxpayers’ expense he noted that the secret service in recent years has frequently received permission from congress to exceed the overtime and salary cap this occurred as recently as 2016 during president barack obama’s final year in office alles called the agency’s current predicament first reported by usa today “an ongoing issue for nearly a decade due to an overall increase in operational tempo” without question however the agency’s workload for security personnel has grown under trump the secret service now protects 42 people around the clock 11 more than it did under obama the trump protection number includes 18 members of the president’s family the cap has been exceeded by at least some amount in recent years but fewer agents were affected usually 300 compared with 1300 in 2016 when agents protected obama hillary clinton and trump during the campaign according to the office of rep elijah e cummings dmd the top democrat on the house committee on oversight and government reform since he took office the president’s inclination to conduct official business with crowds around him — such as a working dinner he held in february with japanese prime minister shinzo abe at maralago with diners nearby — has required protection the farflung travel of his four adult children and soninlaw also have pushed up security costs members of

funded and the agents treated fairly while acknowledging the difficult and important job they have” oversight committee chairman trey gowdy rsc said in a statement cummings said in a statement that he

republican efforts to eradicate president barack obamas proudest domestic achievement ended friday before a single vote was cast house speaker paul ryan sensationally pulled his obamacare repeal bill from the floor friday afternoon a day after president donald trump had threatened to walk away from health care reform if he didnt get a vote we were very close trump said in the oval office after the bill was pulled it was a very very tight margin the decision to delay the vote marks an acute embarrassment for the president who had gambled big by presenting holdout house conservatives with a takeitorleave it ultimatum thursday night and put his own credibility on the line but trump repeatedly pointed the finger directly at democrats who all opposed the measure rather than at his own party which holds a significant majority in the house we had no democratic support he said ive been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we could do politically speaking is let obamacare explode its exploding right now trump reiterated the point in a tweet saturday morning saying obamacare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great health care plan for the people do not worry obamacare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for the people do not worry — donald j trump realdonaldtrump march 25 2017 the failure of the gop plan also puts ryan in a much weakened political position after being defied by his own conference which seems just as unsuited to governing in the trump era as it was when it was effectively a protest coalition under obama it became clear during a day of intense political intrigue that despite fierce armtwisting by trump ryan and other leaders that the votes simply were not there to pass the bill and the leadership and the white house were headed for a lopsided defeat they were unable to narrow the schism between freedom caucus conservatives who believe the bill keeps too much of obamacare intact and moderates who worry they will pay an electoral price if millions of americans lose health insurance the house meltdown on obamacare repeal has perilous implications for the american health care system with republicans apparently unable to repeal the law but also unwilling to fix the deficiencies that the white house says will collapse the law we came up short ryan told reporters we are going to be living with obamacare for the foreseeable future democrats were gleeful after the failure to even hold a vote in my life i have never seen an administration as incompetent as the one occupying the white house today said senate minority leader chuck schumer the new york democrat who spars often with trump today weve learned they cant count votes and they cant close a deal so much for the art of the deal what happens for trump and ryan politically fridays momentous events will race like wildfire through the republican partys conservative establishment base which has been told repeatedly by candidates that the first order of business with the gop president in the white house would be to repeal of the affordable care act ryan told fellow republicans they are moving on from health care reps andy barr rkentucky and bill flores rtexas told cnn trump said tax reform would be next trump the businessman who touted his ability to get things done and promised to transcend washington politics said hes learned from the experience this was an interesting period of time we all learned a lot he said in the oval office we learned a lot about loyalty and we learned a lot about the vote getting process and we learned about very arcane rules in both the senate and the house certainly for me it was a very interesting experience but for me itll be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan he added the white house maintained after the scrapped vote that it is confident in ryan i like speaker ryan he worked very hard trump said white house press secretary sean spicer said before the vote trump has left everything on the field when it comes to this bill but republicans had few firm commitments from conservatives and watched a continued exodus of moderates this was exactly what house leadership was worried would happen when they changed the bill the source said but tax reform will be no simpler trump acknowledged there are many different groups in the gop meaning things arent as simple as having one party control both the white house house and senate lots of different groups lots of factions and theres been a long history of liking and disliking within the republican party long before i got here he said freedom caucus held out most prominent of those factions the freedom caucus held out until the end saying the bill didnt go enough to repeal obamacare freedom caucus chairman mark meadows a north carolina republican said he still wants to work to repeal obamacare i promised the people of north carolinas 11th district that i would fight for a full repeal of the affordable care act and a replacement with a marketdriven approach that brings down costs and provides more choices for the american people meadows said in a statement vice president mike pence met friday afternoon with members of the freedom caucus at the capitol hill club a source familiar with the meeting said there are clear signs of frustration in the white house at the freedom caucus which has won a series of concession but is still holding out against the bill weve emboldened them one white house aide said rep leonard lance rnew jersey said that without a doubt the decision to concede the repeal of essential health benefits to the freedom caucus definitely moved some of his colleagues to no i suspect some became a no because of that lance said that certainly didnt help what was in the bill the gop health care bill would eliminate many of the taxes and eradicate the individual mandate imposed by obamacare officially known as the affordable care act instead of the obamacare subsidies that are tied to income and premiums the gop plan provides americans with refundable tax credits based mainly on age to purchase health insurance the bill also significantly curtails federal support for medicaid and allows states to require ablebodied adults to work after 2020 states that expanded medicaid would no longer receive enhanced federal funding to cover lowincome adults like they did under obamacare and states that havent expanded would be immediately barred from doing so however the gop bill doesnt touch some of the most popular pieces of obamacare including letting children stay on their parents insurance plans until the age of 26 and including protections for people with preexisting conditions but it would end the requirement that insurers offer comprehensive policies that cover maternity drugs mental health and substance abuse

explosive assertion in a private conversation on capitol hill with his fellow gop leaders that trump could be the beneficiary of payments from russian president vladimir putin “there’s two people i think putin pays rohrabacher and trump” mccarthy rcalif said according to a recording of the june 15 2016 exchange which was listened to and verified by the washington post rep dana rohrabacher is a californian republican known in congress as a fervent defender of putin and russia house speaker paul d ryan rwis immediately interjected stopping the conversation from further exploring mccarthy’s assertion and swore the republicans present to secrecy before the conversation mccarthy and ryan had emerged from separate talks at the capitol with ukrainian prime minister vladi­mir groysman who had described a kremlin tactic of financing populist politicians to undercut eastern european democratic institutions news had just broken the day before in the washington post that russian government hackers had penetrated the computer network of the democratic national committee prompting mccarthy to shift the conversation from russian meddling in europe to events closer to home some of the lawmakers laughed at mccarthy’s comment then mccarthy quickly added “swear to god” ryan instructed his republican lieutenants to keep the conversation private saying “no leaks this is how we know we’re a real family here” the remarks remained secret for nearly a year read the transcript of the conversation among gop leaders obtained by the post the conversation provides a glimpse at the internal views of gop leaders who now find themselves under mounting pressure over the conduct of president trump the exchange shows that the republican leadership in the house privately discussed russia’s involvement in the 2016 election and trump’s relationship to putin but wanted to keep their concerns secret it is difficult to tell from the recording the extent to which the remarks were meant to be taken literally the house leadership has so far stood by the white house as it has lurched from one crisis to another much of the turmoil fueled by contacts between trump or his associates with russia house republican leaders have so far resisted calls for the appointment of an independent commission or a special prosecutor to investigate russian interference though pressure has been mounting on them to do so after trump’s firing of fbi director james b comey and the disclosure that the president shared intelligence with russian diplomats late wednesday deputy attorney general rod j rosenstein announced he had appointed robert s mueller iii a former prosecutor who served as the fbi director from 2001 to 2013 as special counsel to oversee the russia probe deputy attorney general appoints special counsel to oversee probe of russian interference in election evan mcmullin who in his role as policy director to the house republican conference participated in the june 15 conversation said “it’s true that majority leader mccarthy said that he thought candidate trump was on the kremlin’s payroll speaker ryan was concerned about that leaking” mcmullin ran for president last year as an independent and has been a vocal critic of trump when initially asked to comment on the exchange brendan buck a spokesman for ryan said “that never happened” and matt sparks a spokesman for mccarthy said “the idea that mccarthy would assert this is absurd and false” after being told that the post would cite a recording of the exchange buck speaking for the gop house leadership said “this entire yearold exchange was clearly an attempt at humor no one believed the majority leader was seriously asserting that donald trump or any of our members were being paid by the russians what’s more the speaker and leadership team have repeatedly spoken out against russia’s interference in our election and the house continues to investigate that activity” “this was a failed attempt at humor” sparks said ken grubbs a spokesman for rohrabacher said the congressman has been a consistent advocate of “working closer with the russians to combat radical islamism the congressman doesn’t need to be paid to come to such a necessary conclusion” when mccarthy voiced his assessment of whom putin supports suspicions were only beginning to swirl around trump’s alleged russia ties at the time us intelligence agencies knew that the russians had hacked the dnc and other institutions but moscow had yet to start publicly releasing damaging emails through wikileaks to undermine trump’s democratic challenger hillary clinton an fbi counterintelligence investigation into russian efforts to influence the presidential election would open the following month in late july comey has said in testimony to congress trump has sought to play down contacts between his campaign and the russians dismissing as a “witch hunt” the fbi and congressional investigations into russian efforts to aid trump and any possible coordination between the kremlin and his associates trump denies any coordination with moscow took place presidential candidate trump’s embrace of putin and calls for closer cooperation with moscow put him at odds with the house republican caucus whose members have long advocated a harder line on russia with the exception of rohrabacher and a few others among gop leaders in the house mccarthy stood out as a putin critic who in 2015 called for the imposition of “more severe” sanctions for its actions in eastern ukraine and the annexation of crimea in may 2016 mccarthy signed up to serve as a trump delegate at the republican national convention breaking ranks with ryan who said he still was not ready to endorse the candidate mccarthy’s relationship with trump became so close that the president would sometimes refer to him as “my kevin” trump was by then the lone republican remaining in the contest for the nomination though ryan continued to hold out trump picked up endorsements from the remaining gop leaders in the house including rep steve scalise the majority whip from louisiana and republican conference chairman cathy mcmorris rodgers wash — both of whom took part in the june 15 conversation ryan announced on june 2 that he would vote for trump to help “unite the party so we can win in the fall” but continued to clash with the candidate including over putin while trump sought to cast putin as a better leader than thenpresident obama ryan dubbed him an “aggressor” who didn’t share us interests on the same day as ryan’s endorsement clinton stepped up her attacks on trump over his public statements praising putin “if donald gets his way they’ll be celebrating in the kremlin” she said ukrainian officials were unnerved by trump’s statements in support of putin republicans they had believed were supposed to be tougher on russia when trump named paul manafort as his campaign manager in april 2016 alarm bells in kiev started ringing even louder manafort was already well known in ukraine because of his influential role as a political consultant to viktor yanukovych the country’s former kremlinfriendly ruler until a popular uprising forced him to flee to russia manafort had also consulted for a powerful russian businessman with close ties to the kremlin “ukraine was in a sense a testing ground for manafort” said ukrainian political scientist taras berezovets who became a grudging admirer of manafort’s skills in the “dark arts” of political stagecraft while berezovets was working for one of yanukovych’s political rivals at the urging of manafort yanukovych campaigned with populist slogans labeling nato a “menace” and casting “elites” in the ukrainian capital as out of touch berezovets said trump struck similar themes during the 2016 campaign the fbi is now investigating whether manafort who stepped down as trump’s campaign manager in august received offthebooks payments from yanukovych’s party us officials said as part of that investigation fbi agents recently took possession of a newly discovered document that allegedly details payments totaling 750000 ukrainian lawmaker sergii leshchenko who first disclosed the new document declined to comment on his contacts with the fbi a spokesman for manafort has said that trump’s former campaign manager has not been contacted by the fbi manafort has also disputed the authenticity of the newly discovered document groysman on an official visit to washington met separately with ryan and mccarthy on june 15 at the capitol he told them how the russians meddled in european politics and called for “unity” in addressing the threat according to us and ukrainian officials ryan issued a statement after the meeting saying “the united states stands with ukraine as it works to rebuild its economy and confront russian aggression” later ryan spoke privately with mccarthy rodgers scalise and rep patrick t mchenry rnc the deputy whip among others 1 of 41 full screen

governments” ryan said russia’s goal was to “turn ukraine against itself” groysman underlined russia’s intentions saying “they’re just going to roll right through us and go to the baltics and everyone else” according to ryan’s summary of the prime minister’s remarks in the recording “yes” rodgers said in agreement noting that the russians were funding nongovernmental organizations across europe as part of a wider “propaganda war” “maniacal” ryan said “and guess guess who’s the only one taking a strong stand up against it we are” rodgers disagreed “we’re not we’re not but we’re not” she said that’s when mccarthy brought the conversation about russian meddling around to the dnc hack trump and rohrabacher “i’ll guarantee you that’s what it is the russians hacked the dnc and got the opp opposition research that they had on trump” mccarthy said with a laugh ryan asked who the russians “delivered” the opposition research to “there’s there’s two people i think putin pays rohrabacher and trump” mccarthy said drawing some laughter “swear to god” mccarthy added “this is an off the record” ryan said some lawmakers laughed at that “no leaks all right” ryan said adding “this is how we know

billionaire media personality gave a speech during a hollywood award show where fellow millionaires and billionaires get dressed up in ten thousand dollar gowns and tuxes to pat each other on the back within nanoseconds of her admittedly powerful speech desperate liberals and democrats were suddenly chanting “oprah for president” of course ms winfrey has sent some mixed messages as to whether she will run for president but as i’ve long ago observed in politics denials have all the value of “a bucket of warm piss” but if she did decide to run i get the feeling from reading posts across social media she’d move to head of the class of democratic candidates for president of the united states she’d surpass more highly qualified progressive democrats such as elizabeth warren and kirsten gillibrand who both would get my unconditional support for president as if anyone would care so why am i commenting on potential presidential candidates two years before the election i’m sure some of you readers are mumbling “stick to science you dumb feathered dinosaur that’s why i’m here” but kind madam it is about science and based on science a push for “oprah for president” will not get my support science and politics i am not a oneissue voter and i generally don’t utilize litmus tests for progressives for example i’m pragmatic – i know that for a democrat to win in north dakota she has to be a lot more conservative than i am a moderate or conservative democrat in north dakota is infinitely better than your standard unpatriotic rightwing republican however i brook no argument when it comes to science for me it’s a line in the sand you do not get to pick and choose the science that you want to accept you do not get use your preconceived conclusions to state what is real or fake science the important science issues of our day in no particular order are vaccines climate change evolution gmos alternative medicine the scientific consensus constitutes a huge body of scientific studies that all agree with and support one another scientists come to this consensus as a result of consistent published evidence it is not a result of personal opinions or an a priori conclusion the scientific consensus tells us that vaccines are relatively safe and very effective in preventing deadly diseases and they are not linked to autism the scientific consensus position of the american association for the advancement of sciences on anthropogenic humancaused climate change the scientific evidence is clear global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now and it is a growing threat to society accumulating data from across the globe reveal a wide array of effects rapidly melting glaciers destabilization of major ice sheets increases in extreme weather rising sea level shifts in species ranges and more the pace of change and the evidence of harm have increased markedly over the last five years the time to control greenhouse gas emissions is now evolution is an observable scientific fact no different than observing gravity or light the theory of evolution which describes the mechanism of evolution is supported by bodies of published evidence that is so overwhelming that it is close to impossible to imagine any scientific experiment that could refute it the aaas has also released another statement of consensus of science on genetically modified foods pdf the science is quite clear crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe … the world health organization the american medical association the us national academy of sciences the british royal society and every other respected organization that has examined the evidence has come to the same conclusion consuming foods containing ingredients derived from gm crops is no riskier than consuming the same foods containing ingredients from crop plants modified by conventional plant improvement techniques alternative medicine is unsupported by robust scientific evidence – it is called “alternative” because any alternative medicine that is supported by substantial scientific evidence is just called “medicine” acupuncture traditional chinese medicine chiropractic homeopathy and many other alternative “medicine” practices do not work yes everyone has their cherished anecdotes not scientific data cherrypicked research special pleadings appeal to nature and appeal to popularity to support their beliefs about alternative medicine but it’s still pseudoscience yeah i know there are other ignorant beliefs about science out there there are lots of people who think the moon landings were faked that nuclear power is bad that the earth is flat or that sasquatch actually exists but the top five i listed above are probably the most important but i’m pretty certain i would not vote for a candidate who thought sasquatch was running around on a flat earth outside of the studios that broadcast the fake moon landings many people like to assign to science some magical system of “belief” but that’s not how it works scientific ideas are based on evidence derived from the scientific method not on opinion you may think that gmos are dangerous but that’s an illinformed opinion unsupported by the vast scientific body of work that says that gmos are safe to humans animals and the environment maybe you’ve invented some belief set about gmos based on your opinions about something you heard or from some cherrypicked article in an obscure journal unless you have robust evidence superior to what real science used to form a broad consensus to dismiss the safety of gmos then you have nothing absolutely nothing if you are a politician running for office especially to be president of the united states you also don’t get to pick and choose your science especially to pander to those on the right and left who are science deniers if you take some position that can be described as antiscience like trump did with regards to vaccines then you cannot be trusted to be the chief science officer of the nation ironically trump chose responsible and highquality scientists for positions like cdc director and surgeon general he didn’t do the same for most of the other important science positions within the executive branch including the epa where he placed a climate change denier in charge this supports my point – if a politician denies one science can you trust them on any other science generally no oprah for president – a science denier i generally don’t write about billionaire media personalities other than donald trump of course because i normally don’t think they have much to offer to benefit mankind at least from a scientific sense they don’t spend a nanosecond researching a treatment for any of the 200 or so cancers they don’t spend time researching vaccines in a scientific lab they don’t help people get healthcare coverage they lack any credentials in any field other than making movies or tv shows they are wealthy oligarchs who know little about your lives and your needs and even less about science and when it comes to science they have two choices – keep quiet since they know approximately nothing that matters in science or find out what the scientific consensus is and support it with all their strength we hear about celebrities like jenny mccarthy who invented bogus science about vaccines and people listen not sure why but that’s the world we live in and that leads me to this oprah for president push by some democrats her science credentials are not unknown and on my scale of scientific acceptability she fails the science litmus by almost the same margin as donald trump let’s review some of the key issues that i consider “lines in the sand” when it comes to science vaccines ms winfrey has been a strong supporter of said jenny mccarthy who is simply a member of the antivaccine religion she pushes pseudoscience and junk medicine when it comes to vaccines and autism – a link that simply does not exist except in the minds of who wouldn’t know science if they spotted them 6 letters to spell it here’s a key interview between winfrey and mccarthy that was excerpted from seth mnookin’s book the panic virus the true story behind the vaccineautism controversy in it jenny describes to winfrey her education on vaccines autism and treatments mccarthy first thing i did—google i put in autism and i started my research winfrey thank god for google mccarthy i’m telling you winfrey thank god for google mccarthy the university of google is where i got my degree from… and i put in autism and something came up that changed my life that led me on this road to recovery which said autism—it was in the corner of the screen—is reversible and treatable and i said what that has to be an ad for a hocus pocus thing because if autism is reversible and treatable well then it would be on oprah no ms winfrey we do not thank anyone for using google to make decisions on something as important as protecting children from deadly dangerous diseases like polio measles and diphtheria i worked in science and it took me eight years of college and grad school and then 30 years in medical research and development to get to the point where i can grasp difficult scientific subjects one does not learn about epidemiology and immunology with 20 minutes on google if it were that easy everyone would be doing it and i know for a fact that most people who troll the internet with their lame university of google degrees wouldn’t know the difference between an immune system and an hvac system and there’s more actually winfrey hosted mccarthy twice on her show to push science fiction about vaccines and autism the insolent orac summarizes their “scientifically ignorant nonsense” …about her son evan having become autistic after vaccination and how she was treating him with all manner of “autism biomed” interventions ie quackery to “heal” him you might remember this one it was famous because mccarthy told winfrey that her “mommy instinct”told him that it was the vaccines that were responsible for her son’s autism in response oprah mildly “challenged” mccarthy’s view as even friendly hosts sometimes do in order to give their guests a chance to respond to criticism in a safe environment in this case winfrey read a response from the cdc about how science does not support the idea that vaccines cause autism mccarthy full of her usual arrogance of ignorance scoffed speaking of evan “he is my science” winfrey did not reject that comment from mccarthy winfrey did not say that the cdc is made up of some of the top public health scientists on the planet who would know more about vaccine science in their left pinkies than mccarthy has in her whole brain several people on the provaccine side of the equation wanted to refute mccarthy on winfrey’s show but that never happened eventually oprah winfrey’s harpo studios signed mccarthy to do a new talk show although the show never happened does this make oprah winfrey a vaccine denier herself going by transitive evidence which shows winfrey’s strong support of jenny mccarthy whose fame at the time was based around her antivaccine rhetoric we can only conclude that winfrey had a tacit approval of this antivaccine religion if she strongly supported the use of vaccines why didn’t oprah winfrey call mccarthy out on this why would she agree with mccarthy that google the is equivalent to advanced degrees that actually have relevance to vaccine research why didn’t she defend the cdc dr oz and dr phil oprah winfrey foisted onto the world one dr mehmet oz one of the most reprehensible pushers of scientific nonsense and medical woo that has ever passed before my eyes and i will never forgive dr oz’s pathetic and pandering review of donald trump’s medical exam which gave us nothing about trump’s health it was just a lovefest between two science deniers and salesmen in case the reader of this blog think i’ve lost my mind about dr oz let me refer once again to the cheeky orac who calls him “america’s quack” sorry world dr oz appeared as a regular guest on the oprah winfrey show for about five years then he got his own syndicated show in 2009 produced by oprah winfrey’s harpo studios he also has several other shows on her cable network own that would be bad enough if ms winfrey also didn’t push another purveyor of medical woo – in this case it would be dr phil for those of you who are unfamiliar with this person phil mcgraw is a beverly hills “psychologist” who had an “advice” show produced by oprah winfrey’s harpo studios since 2002 the problem with dr phil is rather simple – he is one of the most outspoken proponents of pseudoscience and woo in mental health the skeptical inquirer wrote is he a good doctor well first of all he’s not a medical doctor nor a licensed therapist he does have a phd and while some would argue that it’s misleading to call oneself “doctor” without practicing medicine technically anyone with a doctorate can claim the honorific but dr phil’s show is a show about real people not abstract academic concepts when he sits down with someone suffering from a seriously incapacitating illness such as obsessive compulsive disorder or bipolar disorder do they realize that this “doctor” merely completed a phd program and wrote a dissertation on rheumatoid arthritis in 1979 in other words like jenny mccarthy and vaccines he has no experience or knowledge of treating individuals with serious mental health issues worse yet the skeptical inquirer points out several individual cases where he used unorthodox pseudoscientific “treatments” for guests on his show orac also points out that “dr phil mcgraw…also stands accused of providing alcohol and drugs to addicts featured on his show in order to ramp up the drama factor” mental health advocates and professionals who actually understand how to treat those with mental health issues would be appalled by his woo if they actually watched his woo because real therapists and psychiatrists have decades of education and clinical training in treating those with serious mental health issues – and they generally stick with the best that science has established for treatments dr phil mcgraw ought to stick to rheumatoid arthritis i suppose maybe you can invent some wall between jenny mccarthy’s views and oprah winfrey but it becomes short of impossible to do so with regards to drs oz and phil they promote medical woo – it’s not just something we can ignore it is dangerous and can be deadly to people who watch these shows and i’m overlooking for brevity purposes since this is getting close to 4000 words her embracing the pseudoscience from many others including suzanne somers and christiane northrup if we are to get behind oprah for president how do we excuse these two shows that give us pseudoscience and if you listed out everything these two doctors have said would hit about hundreds or thousands of different claims that are utterly dismissed by real science but more importantly how many people were harmed by winfrey’s tacit or explicit support of pseudoscience in medicine how many people think that dr phil actually knows anything about mental health treatment or dr oz’s quack medicine oprah loves the secret if you don’t know about the secret consider yourself lucky it is a new age book of mystical beliefs based on the pseudoscientific “law of attraction” which claims that if we all got together with our minds we could change anything including the world around us it is “a timeworn trick of mixing banal truisms with magical thinking and presenting it as some sort of hidden knowledge…” this magical thinking is what rules over the beliefs in all things alternative medicine because we know homeopathy is scientifically implausible and we know it doesn’t work the only way to believe it would work is if it is imbued with magic and ms winfrey has been an outspoken promoter of this new age garbage in a salon article entitled “oprah’s ugly secret“ an examination of ms winfrey’s embracing of that book the authors wrote the main idea of “the secret” is that people need only visualize what they want in order to get it — and the book certainly has created instant wealth at least for rhonda byrne and her partnersincon and the marketing idea behind it — the enlisting of that dream team in what is essentially a massive crosspromotional pyramid scheme — is brilliant but what really makes “the secret” more than a variation on an old theme is the involvement of oprah winfrey who lends the whole enterprise more prestige and because of that prestige more venality than any previous selfhelp scam oprah hasn’t just endorsed “the secret” she’s championed it put herself at the apex of its pyramid and helped create a symbiotic economy of new age quacks that almost puts opec to shame so it’s more than believing in quackery it is also a scam again you might think it is unimportant because people believe in strange things you might be right but let’s go back to my good buddy orac at respectful insolence that goes to my point that i’m trying to make maybe winfrey doesn’t believe in all of this magical woo but if she wasn’t why didn’t she publicly criticize jenny mccarthy why doesn’t she cancel dr mcgraw’s show for harming those who are mentally ill why doesn’t she push back against dr oz’s medical nonsense and why didn’t she decide her attachment to the secret may endanger lives one more thing about oprah for president there is one additional issue from ms winfrey that is troubling – it is tangentially about science ms winfrey has some odd biases against atheists during her show in october 2013 she was interviewing her guest diana nyad an incredible american swimmer who swam from cuba to florida when in her 60s nyad also happens to be an atheist and said on the show that she was “deeply in awe” of what she sees in the world ms winfrey replied that well i don’t call you an atheist then i think if you believe in the awe and the wonder and the mystery then that is what god is that is what god is it’s not the bearded guy in the sky in other words winfrey rejected the belief that atheists can find wonder and awe in the world because they don’t believe in a god that angers me because it is a typical thing that religious crackpots say about atheists i make no secret pun intended of being an atheist it does not define me science does and frankly i became an atheist because of science and the scientific method however i try not to conflate science with atheism – though science can lead to atheism there are religious scientists the discoverer of the big bang scientific theory not the tv show was a jesuit priest on the other hand when i see oprah winfrey’s embracing of science denialism i start to see a pattern her arrogance to believe that her views are right despite scientific evidence is offensive and it is a line which we cannot cross even with atheism she presumes to know how an atheist feels without any evidence to support her beliefs my answer to oprah for president – no for now i’m not opposed to an oprah for president push because of her inexperience in government – we have had a year of an inexperienced media celebrity running our country so maybe experience should be an issue and one of the reasons i was a strong hillary clinton supporter i’m certainly not opposed to her because she’s an african american woman – my bona fides on racism and misogyny are clear to those who have met the feathered dinosaur and she certainly is more intelligent and empathetic than that deranged lunatic in the white house now however it’s the science that makes me take a deep breath and say no i could not and would not support oprah for president being 100 on the right side of science is important potus chooses the cdc director the fda commissioner the epa director and hundreds if not thousands of people to key science positions we cannot trust presidents to do the right thing with science because we support them i want a president that i know is in line on all key issues of science that matter to our world today if you fail the “litmus test” of science you do not get my vote even if the guy on the other side is a horrific example of humanity and also fails that same litmus test i will not vote for oprah short of a complete and clear disavowal of all the cargo cult science she has promoted over the years and remember it’s not just a statement or two she needs to disavow it’s volumes of it what happens if it’s oprah vs trump i’ll make a sacrifice to the gods of darwin to save us all like this like loading related 47k 54k shares the original skeptical raptor lifetime lover of science

Republicans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2017/mar/28/america-party-less-caring-21-century-republicans-gop,wenchette,3336,1112,last week i was taking an uber i know i’m sorry it was a necessity across an unfamiliar town when the driver whom i’ll call randy started telling me about this cool dude named jesus randy’s big opener earlier in the ride was to gesture at a homeless man panhandling by the side of the road and say “isn’t it terrible” “yeah” i agreed though i was unsure whether he was referring to homelessness as a blight or a form of state violence “i can’t believe my tax money pays for the president’s golf vacations while people are freezing to death on the street it’s robbery” “true that” he said to my relief “i hope this crazy country gets itself figured out before things get worse” “me too” i said “i would really like to keep living” “yeah” randy pounced “how would you like to live … forever” unfortunately his offer had the opposite of its intended effect as i immediately and permanently died an undeterred randy proceeded to explain to my corpse that christmas isn’t real and the bible predicted that the earth was round which was proof that the bible was science fact this went on for the next 20 minutes during which randy got lost twice as he was apparently proselytising too hard to look at the gps it was less a rideshare and more a lowgrade kidnapping for which i was being charged to his credit though it did feel like eternity but if there’s anything 21stcentury american life has prepared me for it’s an old man taking possession of my body and incompetently steering it in directions i don’t want to go while ignoring my boundaries and lecturing me on the one right way to live at least randy cared about that homeless guy though which is more than i can say for the republican party i’ve been thinking a lot about the notion of “care” lately care can be florid and romantic or bureaucratic and dry it is maintenance and stewardship and only sometimes love you can take care of something without personally caring about it which is precisely what we pay our elected officials to do take care of our communities and our planet whether or not you share our priorities and fears and weaknesses and religions and sexual orientations and gender identities and skin colours we put ourselves and our money in your hands take care i don’t know that america has ever seen a political party so divested of care since trump took office republicans have proposed legislation to destroy unions the healthcare system the education system and the environmental protection agency to defund the reproductive health charity planned parenthood and restrict abortion to stifle public protest and decimate arts funding to increase the risk of violence against trans people and roll back antidiscrimination laws and to funnel more and more wealth from the poorest to the richest every executive order and piece of gop legislation is destructive aimed at dismantling something else never creating anything new never in the service of improving the care of the nation contemporary american conservatism is not a political philosophy so much as the roiling negative space around barack obama’s legacy can you imagine being that insecure can you imagine not wanting children to have healthcare because you’re embarrassed a black guy was your boss it would be sad if it wasn’t so dangerous that void at the heart of the party that loss of any tether to humanity is breeding anxiety on both sides of the political divide according to the atlantic florida republican tom rooney recently turned on his cohort with surprising lucidity “i’ve been in this job eight years and i’m racking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that’s been something positive that’s been something other than stopping something else from happening we need to start having victories as a party and if we can’t then it’s hard to justify why we should be back here” vindictive obstructionism it seems is not particularly nourishing for the soul in the wake of the republican party’s luscious succulent failure to obliterate the affordable care act obamacare and replace it with catastrophic nationwide poverty and death an old video of a paul ryan gaffe went viral “we’re not going to give up” ryan assures his audience “on destroying the healthcare system for the american people” the clip is from 2013 not 2017 and obviously ryan did not mean to say into a microphone that he wants to destroy the healthcare system but here’s the thing i talk into a microphone in front of people all the time and not once have i ever accidentally said “hitler was pretty cool” when what i meant to say was “throw all nazis into the sea” even if we acknowledge that such a slip of the tongue is technically possible if not likely we don’t actually need to wonder about what ryan secretly believes gaffe or no we already know he wants to destroy the healthcare system for the american people because he tried to pass legislation that would destroy the healthcare system for the american people and because destruction not life is the foundation of ryan’s party listen to people and political parties when they tell you who they are don’t trust those who get lost when they’re claiming to show you the way zero stars
5p3r24,2017-01-20 15:03:46,Democrats,Donald Trump’s Plan to Replace Obamacare Does Not Exist,http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/01/the_genius_of_donald_trump_s_nonexistent_plan_to_replace_obamacare.html,CharlieDarwin2,3239,1138,has donald trump spent months secretly crafting a toptobottom transformation of our broken health system that will patch up america’s scrapes and bruises and straighten the nation’s teeth all signs point to no a week ago trump told the washington post that he was putting the finishing touches on a new health reform plan that would guarantee “insurance for everybody” alas he offered no details other than to say that his plan would offer “much lower deductibles” and that it would be released very soon in a detailed account of intrarepublican wrangling over the future of obamacare yuval levin reports that “the conservative healthcare universe including some people on trump’s own team quickly concluded that the separate administration plan he described was entirely a figment of trump’s imagination” considering it doesn’t exist trump’s imaginary health care proposal has accomplished a great deal for one it has tempered the enthusiasm of congressional republicans for unraveling obamacare too quickly it’s reminded them that the road to replacing obamacare is fraught with peril for the gop and that “insurance for everybody” is a message that appeals not just to democrats but to a growing number of republicans first let’s consider the argument that there is nothing for republicans to worry about and that to delay obamacare repeal would be to play into the hands of democrats the basic idea here perfectly distilled in a recent wall street journal oped by betsy mccaughey is that obamacare didn’t really do anything of value so getting rid of it won’t make much of a difference one of the chief political arguments in favor of passing and now keeping obamacare was that millions of americans faced the prospect of being denied insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions and that obamacare would eliminate that possibility but according to mccaughey having a preexisting condition was only an issue for individuals seeking insurance coverage in the individual market since roughly half of americans 49 percent are covered by employerbased insurance and another third are covered by medicare 20 percent and medicaid 14 percent preexisting conditions were irrelevant for most people we didn’t need obamacare to tackle this problem she insists rather we needed to establish highrisk pools for the small number of people who fell through the cracks mccaughey argues that while obamacare premium subsidies will cost 56 billion this year fully funded highrisk pools would cost something on the order of 16 to 20 billion sounds simple right roll everything back to the preobamacare status quo add some highrisk pools and you’re good to go there is a problem with mccaughey’s line of analysis however it’s true that the political case for obamacare rested in no small part on the fear that preexisting conditions would render tens of millions of people uninsurable but the deeper problem then as now is that half of us adults have at least one chronic health condition such as heart disease cancer diabetes and arthritis among many others most people with these conditions can’t come close to covering all of the costs associated with their medical care which means that other people—family members employers or taxpayers at large—have to cover the rest yes the preexisting condition problem is a relatively narrow one that affects workingage adults who are too young for medicare who earn too much money to qualify for medicaid and who don’t receive health insurance from an employer as james capretta and tom miller explained back in 2010 the chronic disease problem on the other hand is far broader and more profound and republicans ignore it at their peril when families are left to bear the financial burden of chronic disease their economic wellbeing is endangered as millions of americans can tell you based on firsthand experience as health care costs for employers rise an everlarger share of compensation comes in the form of health benefits rather than wages which partly explains why wage growth has been so sluggish for middleincome workers soaring health costs led many employers to drop coverage in the preobamacare era and they’re the reason why at least some have reduced the work hours of their employees to skirt obamacare’s employer mandate what if we let state governments carry the load when that happens—and it is already happening—spending on other government services from public education to transportation gets crowded out unlike the federal government states are constrained by the need to balance their budgets which is why they’re left to beg for federal bailouts when the economy takes a dive and tax revenues plummet one way or another and whether we like it or not voters are going to look to the federal government to do something about the cost of chronic conditions so does that mean republicans should give up on moving beyond obamacare not at all but they need to accept that the federal government will always be the payer of last resort for the chronically ill there is at least one republican who understands this instinctively in his 2000 manifesto the america we deserve donald trump offered the following riff on universal coverage which avik roy recently quoted on his blog i’m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one we should not hear so many stories of families ruined by healthcare expenses we must not allow citizens with medical problems to go untreated because of financial problems or red tape … working out detailed plans will take time but the goal should be clear our people are our greatest asset we must take care of our own we must have universal healthcare if trump did have a plan that would offer “insurance for everybody” what might it look like it’s hard to say my suggestion is that he declare an obamacare truce keep the obamacare exchanges as a safety net for those who need comprehensive coverage and can’t afford it without premium subsidies but also tweak the law to allow the young and healthy to buy cheap nonobamacarecompliant plans if they’re willing to go without subsidies but as i’ve written it’s not really trump’s job to come up with detailed policy proposals his job is to hector congress into doing his bidding and shilling for an imaginary health care plan was as good a way as any to get real policy ideas rolling in trump is saying essentially this is what i want this is what the american people want now go figure out a way to do it and if you don’t i’m going to call you horrible names on twitter
5v7yop,2017-02-21 01:20:02,Democrats,Conservatives Shocked To Discover That Milo Yiannopoulos Is A Terrible Human Being,https://mediamatters.org/blog/2017/02/20/conservatives-shocked-discover-milo-yiannopoulos-terrible-human-being/215400,anutensil,3044,859,update simon schuster has cancelled the publication of yiannopoulos book just two days after news broke that breitbartcom’s serial harasser milo yiannopoulos would speak at this year’s conservative political action conference cpac the conference’s hosts have rescinded his speaking invitation after video circulated of yiannopoulos “condoning pedophilia” while cpac is now trying to do damage control there were any number of reasons not to elevate yiannopoulos before the video resurfaced and anyone familiar with yiannopoulos’ persona including the leadership at cpac should have known that continuing to ally themselves with a champion of the socalled “altright” would eventually lead to something like this milo yiannopoulos is a senior editor at breitbartcom the “altright” website formerly run by stephen bannon president donald trump’s chief strategist bannon is still set to speak at cpac this year yiannopoulos has spent years positioning himself as the poster boy for radical “free speech” traveling on speaking tours and doing publicity stunts that target hurt and harass women people of color undocumented students and the transgender community among other already atrisk groups he was a key figure in the 2014 “gamergate” harassment campaign and was also permanently banned from twitter for his role in the targeted online attacks on black actress leslie jones after she starred in an allfemale remake of ghostbusters more recently yiannopoulos targeted a transgender student during an appearance on his college tour displaying the student’s name and photo on a giant screen as the breitbart livestream of his speech featured a camera with crosshairs scanning across the audience a “trigger cam” this behavior is typical of the breitbart senior editor yiannopoulos and his misogynist “altright” fans encourage each other constantly within smaller online communities repurposing cartoons speaking in code to one another and seeking out new individuals to target outside of their “altright” white nationalist base cpac was apparently ready to reward yiannopoulos’ dangerous behavior with more speaking time at its conference than the sitting vice president was offered on saturday the hollywood reporter broke news that yiannopoulos was reportedly set to deliver the keynote speech at cpac next weekend yiannopoulos said the speech would focus on his “experiences in america battling feminists black lives matter the media professors and the entertainment industry” some conservatives were not pleased matt schlapp the chairman of the american conservative union the group that hosts cpac subsequently released a statement clarifying that yiannopoulos was not the conference’s keynote speaker but would remain one of 75 speakers in total then on sunday night video emerged on twitter that “appeared to show the farright agitator defending pedophilia” the shared videos in which yiannopoulos seems to defend sexual relationships between 13yearold boys and older men or women and joke about sexual abuse “werent new they were repackaged and published on twitter by a conservative account clearly critical of the cpac invite” the conservative twitter account behind the original video “the reagan battalion” has since posted several more videos of yiannopoulos including another in which he makes light of sexual assault and a longer unedited cut as well as the full original video in response to yiannopoulos’ original defense that the video was “selectively edited” after the videos made the rounds on twitter more conservative figures belatedly expressed disappointment and horror at yiannopoulos’ cpac role and now just two days after the initial reports of his planned speech broke cpac has rescinded yiannopoulos’ invitation due to the “offensive video” but schlapp and the larger conservative movement that’s increasingly relied on heinous “altright” harassment bros to drum up support knew what they were doing when they invited yiannopoulos to speak at their annual conference it is worth reiterating that the reagan battalion videos were not new and neither are any of the other things milo yiannopoulos has said and done over the years it’s not news that yiannopoulos thinks the campus sexual assault epidemic is a “fantasy” or that he will say literally anything for attention no matter how outofbounds it’s not a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to the “altright” white nationalist movement breitbart has supported that yiannopoulos repeatedly frames targeted harassment campaigns of transgender individuals black women and undocumented students as some disgusting testament to his own conveniently warped understanding of the first amendment while yiannopoulos is no longer speaking at the event cpac did announce another speaker on monday someone who was caught on tape bragging about sexual assault and then managed to win a presidential campaign

No one ever told Donald NO as a child and he is still a child who absolutely cannot tolerate being told no,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/chris-krebs-fired-by-trump/index.html,flaskman,2370,99,cnn president donald trump on tuesday fired the department of homeland security official who had rejected trumps claims of widespread voter fraud trump announced on twitter he was firing chris krebs the director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency and directly tied it to krebs statement that said there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes changed votes or was in any way compromised the recent statement by chris krebs on the security of the 2020 election was highly inaccurate in that there were massive improprieties and fraud trump said in a tweet that also repeated other baseless conspiracy theories about the election and was flagged by twitter as disputed therefore effective immediately chris krebs has been terminated as director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cnn reported that krebs who ran the cyber arm of the department of homeland security expected to be fired a source close to krebs told cnn he knew he might get in trouble for telling the truth but realized his dismissal could come soon when media organizations that are friendly to the president started to attack him he learned from trumps tweet he had been fired the source said and responded on twitter himself shortly afterward saying honored to serve we did it right defend today secure tomrorow protect2020 cisa deputy director matt travis the no 2 official at the agency resigned in the wake of krebs firing a source familiar with the matter told cnn travis resigned after the white house made clear he would not take the helm at cisa in a letter seen by cnn cisas chief of staff emily early informed the staff that tuesday was krebs last day with the agency and said the president has designated executive director brandon wales as acting director a change in leadership is not a change in mission and it is essential that we do not lose focus on the important work we collectively undertake on behalf of the american people the letter stated fortunately we have the best workforce in all of government and i know we can count on each of you to continue the excellent work you do every day as we all work together to defend today and secure tomorrow a source described wales as a career former chief of staff and counselor who is highly respected by everyone krebs dismissal underscores the lengths trump is willing to go to punish those who dont adopt his conspiratorial view of the election since cnn and other outlets called the race for presidentelect joe biden trump has refused to accept the results instead pushing baseless conspiracies that his second term is being stolen this includes falsely claiming during an election night address that he had already won reelection that he had won states that were actually still up in the air at the time and that his opponents were perpetuating a fraud in the leadup to the election krebs had often quietly disputed the presidents repeated false claims about mailin ballots but went out of his way to not get drawn into criticizing his boss for spreading lies but in the days that have followed krebs has adopted a more forceful approach regularly posting on twitter often with blaring red siren emojis fact checks of the claims and conspiracy theories being pushed by trump his allies and supporters around the country while his pushback at the presidents falsehoods had frustrated some at dhs krebs was responsible for a widely praised revamp of the departments cybersecurity efforts and increasing coordination with state and local governments as the first director of cisa he served as one of the most key federal national security officials that oversaw an election that by all accounts went very smoothly foreign adversaries were not able to affect any of the votes cisa said and it was the most secure election in american history according to them and the wider group of public and private election officials that was the statement for which the president decided to fire krebs on tuesday evening news of his dismissal drew quick outrage from elected officials and election security experts sen angus king an independent from maine and cochair of the cyberspace solarium commission said in a statement by firing mr krebs for simply doing his job president trump is inflicting severe damage on all americans who rely on cisas defenses even if they dont know it if theres any silver lining in this unjust decision its this i hope that presidentelect biden will recognize chriss contributions and consult with him as the biden administration charts the future of this critically important agency king said in one notably forceful rebuke rep adam schiff the democratic chairman of the house intelligence committee called trumps decision pathetic instead of rewarding this great service president trump is retaliating against director krebs and other officials who did their duty its pathetic but sadly predictable that upholding and protecting our democratic processes would be cause for firing schiff said former dhs general counsel john mitnick also blasted krebs firing as outrageous but not surprising realdonaldtrump has made a habit of firing those who are highly competent have integrity and courage and stand up for the ruleoflaw to cisakrebs it was an honor to serve with you dhsgov and you should wear this as a badge of honor he tweeted ben hovland a trump appointee who is chairman of the us election assistance commission praised krebs during an interview with cnns erin burnett on outfront as a great director who showed a lot of leadership particularly in the election space asked about the presidents false claims of massive voter fraud hovland explained when you talk to election officials across the country theyre confident in the security of this election theyre confident in the outcome of the election that this was a fair election and that americans made their voices heard and weve got to respect the will of the people and the public servants that helped run this election and make this all possible krebs firing also prompted some notable pushback from republicans ohio sen rob portman a member of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee defended krebs work to cnn shortly after his dismissal i know chris ive worked well with him i think hes a real professional the republican said asked if he wished trump hadnt fired krebs portman said yeah i think he was very good i think what he was trying to do in an unprecedented way was to connect with every state in the country and give them what they needed to protect and have a firewall in place to protect against cyber attacks krebs kept up the fact check of the presidents conspiracymongering until the final hours of his tenure tweeting earlier tuesday that claims of manipulation of election systems either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent he was quoting from a letter signed by 59 election specialists that also said that anyone asserting that a us election was rigged is making an extraordinary claim and called them alarming assertions firing krebs a us official previously told cnn would cross a red line and set off alarm bells throughout the national security apparatus marcus fowler a former cia officer who now works as the director of strategic threat at the cybersecurity firm darktrace described krebs to cnn as a dr anthony faucilike figure for election and cyber security speaking truth to power about the security of the election based on the facts on the ground and the analysis of his subject matter experts his forced departure at this critical time will absolutely degrade our national security sends a horrible message and exposes vulnerability to our adversaries and puts the credibility of the core democratic value of voting at risk of being undermined manipulated and hijacked fowler said still his dismissal comes after several of the pentagons most senior civilian officials were replaced with officials perceived as loyal to the president and reports of trumps increasing frustration with cia director gina haspel this story has been updated with additional developments on tuesday

mobs,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/20/21225016/protests-stay-at-home-orders-trump-conservative-group-michigan,jonfla,2256,119,don’t be fooled by fox news donald trump or the same type of groups that produced the tea party a decade ago the protesters taking to the streets against social distancing are a small minority of americans — and their attitudes represent a fraction of public opinion in fact america has done something remarkable in this moment it has united last week 81 percent of americans told pollsters for a politicomorning consult poll that the country “should continue to social distance for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus even if it means continued damage to the economy” let me repeat that 81 percent of americans agree that’s an astounding figure an nbc poll found a lower rate at 60 percent but still a solid majority large majorities of democrats and independents are more concerned about the virus than the economy as are about half of republicans this consensus is striking given that americans live in an era when they’re divided along party lines on everything from climate change to the nfl but continued vigilance is required trump will keep trying to divide americans ahead of the election this fall fox will continue to air images that make the antisocialdistancing movement look mainstream wellfunded conservative groups will gin up more events this is the same playbook that worked in 2009 when the conservative machine sparked the tea party which shaped american policy for a decade tea party politics delayed the recovery from the great recession hobbled attempts to expand health care coverage that is desperately needed right now and left the medicalsupply stockpile underfunded putting medical providers in grave danger as they fight to save the lives of covid19 patients the stakes are too high to fall for the same pantomime socialdistancing supporters are the dominant movement and the country needs to remember it trump and fox are putting lives at stake trump’s approach to the pandemic has been to crow about his administration’s imaginary successes while blaming governors for everything that’s gone wrong on friday he escalated his message endorsing the antistayathome protests cropping up across the country — specifically the protests in battleground states run by democratic governors moments after fox news aired a segment on the rallies trump tweeted their rally cry against their governors “liberate” liberate michigan — donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 17 2020 trump has peddled dangerous misinformation about the virus since the start he’s undermined policies encouraged by the cdc he told americans they should wear masks outside but quickly added that he doesn’t plan to this endorsement is perhaps the most dangerous thing he’s said there’s a lot that’s not yet known about covid19 but we do know that gatherings spread the virus again and again when groups get together attendees get sick some have died and we don’t know the extent to which they’ve spread it to others though we know it’s a terribly contagious virus we also know that americans are actually doing a good job social distancing which health experts are crediting with a more optimistic outlook on the number of americans who will die from the virus than initially feared but fox news is trying to convince americans that there’s a groundswell of opposition to these important measures attempting to make small rallies look big and fringe attitudes look mainstream on air they’ve displayed images that make the protests seem significant a first glance at the map below makes it look like a huge number of rallies have already happened but they haven’t it’s a doublewhammy the movement looks large and fox encourages viewers to join the same images were used in the early days of the tea party when fox trumped up the rallies describing them as part of a “revolution” and urging viewers to join conservative groups are playing an important part too three progun groups are behind the largest facebook group encouraging the protests according to an investigation by the washington post in michigan a group funded by trump ally education secretary betsy devos helped get out the word and the same tea party groups that were successful a decade ago are eager to join in trump needs to divide people to win trump won in 2016 in part because of his success with rural white voters in states barack obama won and he’s ratcheting up his strategy to do it again the clearest example is in michigan where democratic gov gretchen whitmer’s instate popularity has soared to 15 percent higher than trump’s nationally her profile is on the rise her name is being floated as a possible vice presidential pick whitmer has become a target of trump’s starting weeks ago and up until protests hit her state last week “we’ve had a big problem with the young a woman governor” trump said in an interview with sean hannity “you know who i’m talking about from michigan” trump dismissed whitmer’s requests for the federal government to provide more medical equipment to her state and said their interactions had “not been pleasant” last week conservative groups in michigan encouraged residents to drive to lansing and snarl traffic in opposition to whitmer’s response to covid19 michigan has been hit harder than most other states during the pandemic it’s the tenthlargest state by population but it has seen the thirdmost deaths whitmer has taken more aggressive steps to combat the spread of the disease than most other governors including extending a statewide stayathome order by two weeks she also ordered bigbox stores like home depot to suspend the sale of nonessential items like gardening supplies and paint during the extension last wednesday some protesters in the state capital of lansing got out of their cars and stood together in a display that quickly turned into a 2016style rally attendees wore maga hats they chanted “lock her up” referring to whitmer and waved protrump signs images from the event showed protesters ignoring socialdistancing rules almost no masks and no regard for social distancing guidelines outside of the governor’s residence mprnews pictwittercom8amlhshyza — evan frost efrostee april 17 2020 trump needs the same rural white voters who carried him then to come out for him again he’s getting them fired up right now in part it’s an effective message because rural areas of michigan have been hit far less hard than blue urban centers like detroit where most of the cases and deaths have been concentrated whether it’ll stay that way with protesters risking bringing it back home is an open question weeks ago trump warned that the cure for the disease can’t be worse than the virus itself many economists have since weighed in arguing that that is a false choice we can take steps to shore up the economy through actions by the fed and stimulus packages in congress while attempting to curb the virus at the same time there’s no way for the economy to turn back on like a light switch covid19 cases in the us are still on the rise and most americans say they wouldn’t go back to normal life even if the rules changed that’s not a recipe for economic recovery the mostrespected plan is the one trump’s own administration has set forth once deaths and new cases are down for a solid period of time once testing can track the virus’s spread the rules can slowly start to change it’s a cautious approach based on the best evidence available it’s not about politics and most americans don’t want it to be

how history will judge their actions in this wrenching moment senators such as john mccain and lindsey graham seem to know it is only a matter of time before the gop will have to confront trump’s unfitness they also sense that flynn’s resignation as national security adviser for lying about the nature of his contacts with russia’s ambassador to the united states raises fundamental concerns about trump himself why do smart people in the white house do stupid things because trump tells them to adriana userothe washington post the immediate political controversy is over how congress should investigate this republican leaders say attention from congress’s intelligence committees is sufficient and for now democrats have agreed to this path but many in their ranks along with some republicans argue it would be better to form a bipartisan select committee that could cross jurisdictional lines and be far more open about its work those pushing for the select committee have reason to fear that keeping things under wraps in the intelligence panels could be a way to bury the story for a while and buy trump time letting americans in on what went on here and quickly is the only way to bolster trust in this administration if that is even possible and let’s face the reality here it could also hasten the end of a presidency that could do immense damage to the united states attorney general jeff sessions in the meantime must immediately recuse himself from all decisions about all aspects of the russia investigation by the fbi and the intelligence services sessions should step back not simply because he is an appointee of the president but more importantly because he was a central figure in the trump campaign he cannot possibly be a neutral arbiter and his involvement would only heighten fears of a coverup in this dark moment we can celebrate the vitality of the institutions of a free society that are pushing back against a president offering the country a remarkable combination of authoritarian inclinations and ineptitude the courts civil servants citizens — collectively and individually — and yes an unfettered media have all checked trump and forced inconvenient facts into the sunlight it is a sign of how beleaguered trump is that his twitter response on wednesday morning was not to take responsibility but to assign blame his villains are leakers and the press “information is being illegally given to the failing nytimes washingtonpost by the intelligence community nsa and fbi just like russia” it is notable that in acknowledging that the news reports are based on “information” trump effectively confirmed them at the same time he was characteristically wrong about russia whose government prevents transparency and punishes those who try to foster it there’s also this kremlin agents stole information from a political party in a free country that is very different from the actions of the media’s informants inside our government who are holding our

months of his campaign in one of the primary debates jeb bush said of trump “he’s a chaos candidate and he’d be a chaos president” rarely has a politician been so prophetic and this is why nearly 11 million more americans voted against trump than for him his obligation was to earn the trust of the 60 percent of americans who told exit pollsters on election day that they viewed him unfavorably

a3pfqf,2018-12-06 18:25:10,Democrats,Republican Gerrymandering Has Basically Destroyed Representative Democracy in Wisconsin,https://www.gq.com/story/republican-gerrymandering-wisconsin,progress18,2019,106,early on wednesday morning after working through the night as the end of the lameduck session approaches the wisconsin state legislature passed a set of bills that will sharply limit the ability of incoming democratic governor tony evers and attorney general josh kaul to do the jobs that the people of wisconsin chose them to do the legislature did this because it is controlled by republicans and as much as republicans profess to love this country and cherish the freedoms that come with living in it one thing they cannot abide is the notion that americans might exercise those freedoms in order to elect people that republicans do not like in the state senate the margins were close 1716 on sb 884 which transfers powers of the attorney general to the legislature and 1815 on sb 886 which requires that the department of health obtain legislative permission before moving to expand medicaid under obamacare but in the assembly they were not 5627 in favor of sb 884 and 5932 in favor of sb 886 this discrepancy arises because there might be no one better at gerrymandering their state to preserve minority rule than badger state republicans in 2010 after republicans won the governorship and control of the state legislature they set about the task of drawing new legislative district boundaries to ensure that theyd never cede that control again this graphic from university of wisconsin political science professor barry burden which depicts the vote share of every newlyelected assemblymember in 2018 shows just how successful they were at that task as he notes it is a breathtakingly skillful display of antidemocratic maneuvering that might merit more appreciation if it werent such galling evidence of moral bankruptcy comparing this years results with those from previous elections provides an even more startling perspective on the gops efficiency as noted by the washington posts philip bump in 2016 republican candidates won 161000 more votes than their democratic counterparts which yielded a 29person gop advantage in the assembly this seems intuitive enough get more votes get more seats at the table in 2018 however democrats received 205000 more votes than republicans which yielded a 27person advantage for republicans the key to a successful gerrymander is making it electionproof drawing the lines to ensure that no matter what constituents want or how they choose to vote their ballots will be tallied in a way that preserves the power of the gerrymanderers in 2016 when trump took wisconsin and ron johnson won his senate reelection bid republicans came away with a healthy majority in the assembly in the 2018 wave election when senator tammy baldwin handily beat a republican challenger and voters ushered scott walker into retirement it was almost the exact same result democrats have spent years raising hell about this unsavory arrangement but so far they have little to show for their efforts in 2016 a federal court in wisconsin found that the map ran afoul of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and ordered the legislature to draw a new one the state appealed however and in june the us supreme court issued its decision in gill v whitford punting on the substance of the challenge and remanding it to the district court to determine whether the plaintiffs have standing to bring suit should it ever return to the supreme court the recent replacement of anthony kennedy who had indicated his disapproval of partisan gerrymandering with republican justice brett kavanaugh does not bode well for the cases future the most vexing obstacle for antigerrymandering activists is that the courts oneperson onevote rule requires that legislative districts be of approximately equal population size—but that as a matter of constitutional law it prescribes nothing about the party preferences of those who live in them the justices role they say is to resolve legal questions not political disputes because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting justice kennedy wrote in 2004s vieth v jubelirer we have no basis on which to define clear manageable and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights whats happening in madison however is pretty compelling evidence that the court needs to find a way to resolve this problem before representative democracy in wisconsin functionally ceases to exist

gm16u2,2020-05-18 16:11:53,Democrats,"Biden Now Leads With Most Senior Demographics — Older Americans' Support for Trump Has Collapsed — ""Let Grandma Die"" Proves Unpopular With Grandma",https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-older-voters-turning-away-from-trump/,wenchette,2007,84,there are different “gaps” in american politics but one that has consistently shown up in recent presidential elections is the age gap that is younger voters tend to vote more democratic and older voters tend to vote more republican in 2016 for instance president trump performed best among voters 65 years and older he also won among those between the ages of 45 and 64 so looking ahead to november you might expect trump to once again do well with older voters however recent public polls — and the president’s own private polling — suggest that trump may be doing worse among older voters against former vice president joe biden the presumptive democratic nominee in national headtohead polls conducted since april 1 trump is barely breaking even with most older americans — and in some age groups he’s even trailing biden by as much as 14 points see 45 to 64yearolds pollsters don’t all use the same age brackets so there is some overlap in the different age categories trump is polling worse with older voters than in 2016 comparison of donald trump’s 2016 vote margin and the average margin in national headtohead polls between trump and joe biden since april 1 by different age groups age group trump 2016 margin trump 2020 margin difference 45 to 64 40 14 54 50 to 64 58 06 52 55 99 04 103 65 133 10 143 polls were averaged by pollster to avoid overweighting one pollster source cooperative congressional election study polls the most startling shift though is among voters age 65 and older four years ago trump bested hillary clinton by 13 points 55 percent to 42 percent according to the cooperative congressional election study a survey of more than 60000 voters organized by harvard university and administered by yougov but now biden narrowly leads trump 48 percent to 47 percent based on an average of 48 national polls that included that age group if those figures hold until november they would represent a seismic shift in the voting behavior of america’s oldest voters the last democratic nominee who won voters 65 and older was al gore in 2000 according to national exit poll data but at the time that was the trend older americans — those who came of age during the great depression and new deal era a period in which the democratic party was dominant — were disproportionately democraticleaning in the late 1990s and early 2000s and political science has found evidence that party loyalties developed at a young age can persist over the course of a person’s life but it’s not just among voters 65 and older where trump is slipping he’s also fallen almost as far among voters 55 and older trump is essentially tied with biden among that age group even after winning these voters by 10 points in 2016 53 percent to 43 percent according to the cces trump’s numbers have also fallen with 45 to 64yearolds as well as 50 to 64yearolds an alternate category employed by many pollsters but the last democrat to win 45 to 64yearolds was barack obama in 2008 — albeit barely 50 percent to 49 percent we don’t have as much statelevel polling to work with but there’s evidence that biden is also doing better with older voters in some key swing states take two recent surveys from florida a state with one of the oldest populations in the country a fox news poll from midapril found biden with a slim 3point lead over trump and running even among voters 45 and older while a quinnipiac university survey from the same period found biden up 4 points overall in florida and leading trump 52 percent to 42 percent among voters 65 and older if this holds this would represent a big swing from 2016 when trump won florida voters 45 and older by 13 points and those 65 and older by 22 points according to the cces but that’s a big if polls can — and will — shift between now and election day we averaged a large number of national polls in our analysis 54 in total but there was still a wide range in the margins from pollster to pollster part of that comes down to the challenges of estimating data for subgroups — like different age groups — which have smaller sample sizes and larger margins of error but there were also sizable differences from pollster to pollster even those using large sample sizes for instance in early april the pew research center found biden trailing trump by 9 points among those 65 and older more in line with trump’s 2016 margin but throughout april and early may morning consult found biden and trump about tied on average among that same age group democrats also tend to poll better among registered voters than among likely voters the group most pollsters are interviewing now so biden’s overall lead might be smaller among those most likely to vote in november still an average of recent tracking polls from firehouse strategiesøptimus — one of the only pollsters currently using a likelyvoter screen — has biden up by 2 points among those 65 and older and up by about 7 points among 45 to 64yearolds so he holds a small lead but nevertheless it’s still a sign that trump is currently underwater with older voters going forward we’ll keep a careful eye on things to see if this shift in voter sentiment holds because if it does it could have a major impact on the outcome in november fivethirtyeight

person was killed mr trump in response to the violence at that rally expressed a moral equivalence between the far right protesters and the demonstrators who met them in virginia – including the young

b8xe36,2019-04-03 15:35:54,Democrats,Betsy DeVos is unfit to lead the Education Department. It's time for her to resign.,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/betsy-devos-unfit-lead-education-department-it-s-time-her-ncna990241,progress18,1907,100,last week secretary of education betsy devos appeared before the house appropriations committee to attempt to justify the trump administration’s 2020 budget request during the committee hearing members of congress — democrats and republicans — had the opportunity to ask her about a number of programs and funding decisions that we found problematic to our students educators and schools her answers only reinforced a truth we have known for two years secretary betsy devos is wholly unfit to oversee this vital department and must resign before her actions wreak even more havoc than has already occurred we’ve long known that president donald trump was proposing dangerous and irresponsible cuts to many critical programs from medicaid and social security to special education and medical research however during tuesday’s hearing with devos representatives pressed her on some of her agency’s most devastating cuts including those to special olympics gallaudet university and the national technical institute for the deaf devos could not defend cutting or eliminating these programs instead only claiming “we had to make some difficult decisions” when trump first nominated betsy devos to lead the department of education there were many red flags that both congress and the american public noticed when trump first nominated betsy devos to lead the department of education there were many red flags that both congress and the american public noticed most alarming was the fact that devos — who was never a public school student teacher principal superintendent or administrator — brings the least amount of public school experience of any secretary in our nation’s history sign up for the think weekly newsletter here during her confirmation hearing devos lack of background in public education became even more clear when she gave downright incoherent confusing and nonsequitur responses to questions on some of the most pressing issues facing american students today she also failed to grasp the critical role that the department of education plays in students’ lives especially for those who may have special needs when she said that enforcement of the individuals with disabilities education act — a federal program that is our nation’s leading source of funding for students in special education programs — is “best left to the states” her nomination should have been withdrawn she was instead confirmed by the senate with vice president mike pence casting the tiebreaking vote the first time in history a vice president has used that power to confirm a nominee to the cabinet over the next several months devos did not change her course on students with special needs or any other public education issues rather her confirmation hearing stood as a prescient display of her fundamental lack of understanding and the cruelty she would deploy as the head of an agency responsible for more than 50 million students and three million teachers in public school systems and nearly 20 million students in american colleges and universities over the last two years devos has repeatedly failed to serve students in america’s public schools choosing to push forward her misguided and grievous plan to rapidly expand the role of charter schools in our education system despite charter schools having a significant failure rate — including some in my home state of wisconsin that i have asked devos to come tour with me — she has pushed for additional funding including an additional 60 million in her latest budget request but devos’s assault on public education does not end with her ultimately retracted call for the elimination of funding for special olympics attacking programs for children with special needs or propping up failing charter schools she has also worked to revoke guidelines on affirmative action and strip protections and rights for lgbtq students — including children who identify as transgender most recently she also refused to answer if she thinks schools should be allowed to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity her complete disdain for american students also does not end with k12 education devos has rolledback obamaera regulations on forprofitcolleges that protect students including fighting to block a law that would help students and graduates who have large amounts of debt and questionable degrees she is also failing at oversight student loan servicers have been allowed to go rogue while the agency charged with serving american students the federal student aid office turns the other way despite the crushing amount of student loan debt owed by americans today devos has tried three times to eliminate the public service loan forgiveness program taking away a program that aids our nation’s teachers firefighters and public servants when you take devos’s record at the department of education as a whole it’s clear she does not value equal access and opportunity for all students rather devos has sided again and again with the special interests and the deeply hurtful and discriminatory policies of the trump administration indeed her actions are really just part of a larger pattern under trump where the government is focused on serving americans who are white wealthy and privileged devos has abandoned students in our cities those that come from underprivileged backgrounds those who identify as lgbtq and many many more students who do not fit into her narrow worldview when you take devos’s record at the department of education as a whole it’s clear she does not value equal access and opportunity for all students our public education system plays a critical in expanding opportunities for the next generation of americans and ensuring that our students — especially for those in marginalized and underserved communities — have the resources they need to succeed however more than two years into the trump administration the damage that is being done by the department of education will cause lasting lifelong effects for millions of students and their families given her continued failure of leadership it is time for betsy devos to step down from her role and allow a committed educational professional to stand up for our nation’s students teachers and administrators and support public education

Obama halved it to $600 billion. Trump’s got it back to a trillion."" — Tweets on Tuesday, July 23rd, 2019 in a tweet",https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/jul/29/tweets/republican-presidents-democrats-contribute-deficit/,therecordcorrected,1899,79,this article was updated aug 2 to include a graph with the annual federal deficit in constant dollars a viral post portrays democrats not republicans as the party of fiscal responsibility with numbers about the deficit under recent presidents to make the case alex cole a political news editor at the website newsitics published the tweet july 23 within a few hours several facebook users posted screenshots of the tweet which claims that republican presidents have been more responsible for contributing to the deficit over the past four decades those posts racked up several hundred likes and shares we also found a screenshot on reddit where it has been upvoted more than 53000 times morons ‘democrats cause deficits’ the original tweet reads reagan took the deficit from 70 billion to 175 billion bush 41 took it to 300 billion clinton got it to zero bush 43 took it from 0 to 12 trillion obama halved it to 600 billion trump’s got it back to a trillion morons “democrats cause deficits” — alex cole acnewsitics july 23 2019 screenshots of the tweet on facebook were flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed read more about our partnership with facebook at politifact we’ve reported extensively on how republicans and democrats often try to pin the federal deficit on each other — muddying the facts in the process so we wanted to see if this facebook post is true we reached out to newsitics the media outlet that cole founded and works for to see what evidence he used to compose the tweet and didn’t hear back our review shows the numbers basically check out but they don’t tell the full story what even is the deficit some people confuse the federal deficit with the debt — but they’re two separate concepts the department of the treasury explains it like this the deficit is the difference between the money that the government makes and the money it spends if the government spends more than it collects in revenues then it’s running a deficit the federal debt is the running total of the accumulated deficits following the money now let’s take a closer look at each president’s impact on the federal deficit to check the numbers in cole’s tweet we went to the federal reserve bank of st louis which has an interactive database for these kinds of figures here’s what we found for each claim president ronald reagan took the deficit from 70 billion to 175 billion this is more or less accurate the federal deficit went from about 789 billion at the beginning of reagan’s presidency to 1526 billion at the end of it at points between 1983 and 1986 the deficit was actually more than 175 billion george hw bush 41 took it to 300 billion close but not exactly the number was around 255 billion at the end of bush’s term the deficit spiked at around 2903 billion the year before he left office bill clinton got it to zero this is true during his presidency clinton managed to zero out the deficit and end his term with a 1282 billion surplus george w bush 43 took it from 0 to 12 trillion this is in the ballpark ignoring the fact that he actually started his presidency with a surplus bush left office in 2009 with a federal deficit of roughly 141 trillion barack obama halved it to 600 billion this is essentially accurate obama left the presidency with a deficit of approximately 5846 billion which is more than halving 141 trillion the deficit was even lower in 2015 at around 4419 billion we had to look for more recent data to back up cole’s allegation that trump’s got it back to a trillion a treasury department statement from june put the federal deficit at about 7471 billion so far this fiscal year but the agency also reported that washington is on track to post a 11 trillion deficit by the end of september which backs up cole’s claim after we published this story some readers asked us to look at the annual deficit in terms of constant dollars which adjust for inflation data since 1940 show that the deficit was highest in 2009 2010 and 2011 — the height of the great recession and the aftermath of the 2009 stimulus package presidential power how much power do presidents have to change the deficit anyway the president does affect the budget by negotiating and signing appropriations bills but there’s a lot more to it first the country’s economic situation has a big impact on the federal deficit the great recession affected the deficit near the end of george w bush’s administration and the beginning of obama’s said stephen ellis executive vice president of the nonprofit taxpayers for common sense there was more spending on safety net programs like food stamps and medicaid and less income from taxes second new presidents take office in january and for the most part inherit the budget from the previous administration for the remainder of the fiscal year — not to mention legislation passed in years prior even the ‘dream budget’ that the president proposes is tied by all sorts of historical obligations and economic conditions tara sinclair an associate professor of economics and international affairs at george washington university told politifact none of that is to say that the president doesn’t have any effect on the deficit ellis said he used reagan’s tax cuts and obama’s stimulus package as examples of how the president can affect deficit spending the combination of spending hikes and tax cuts amplifies deficits trump oversaw both while the rise in spending was bipartisan the tax cuts were a republican effort that trump championed in the time since trump signed his landmark tax cuts and jobs act in december 2017 the deficit has increased by more than 100 billion a congressional budget office report from april 2018 found that the law could add almost 19 trillion to the deficit over 10 years but cole’s tweet still lacks some nuance our ruling a viral tweet made several claims about how the deficit has grown under republican presidents and shrunk under democrats on the whole the numbers presented for each president are basically accurate however it’s worth clarifying that presidents alone are not responsible for the rise and fall of the federal deficit the tweet is accurate but needs additional information we rate it mostly true

senate told reporters last year that kelly would have a “better chance” of winning a new term with lower turnout — a statement that fueled accusations from democrats as to why republicans wanted to go forward with last week’s elections ad ad but heavy mailin balloting may have upended assumptions about relative advantage according to statistics issued monday by the state elections commission nearly 11 million wisconsinites cast ballots that way nearly as many as total turnout in last year’s supreme court race — and more than the total turnout in the court races in each of the previous two years wikler said gop maneuvering could ultimately prove to be a miscalculation especially if a spike in coronavirus infections becomes apparent in the coming days that can be attributed to inperson voting last week “in the months to come most americans might know someone who is hospitalized or has died of covid19” he said “what seems like a cynically clever gambit to win election before a wave of deaths will feel morally bankrupt to most americans by the time we arrive at november” ad ad republicans entered the election with a 52 majority on the state supreme court meaning that a democratic victory still leaves liberals in the minority until 2023 the next time a conservative justice will face voters but an ongoing legal battle over a voter roll purge raised the stakes of this year’s election with implications for november kelly recused himself and conservative justice brian hagedorn sided with voting rights groups to halt the purge that left the court deadlocked 33 and gave democrats a shot at stopping the purge one of their top priorities ahead of the 2020 election trump campaign spokesman tim murtaugh said in a statement that kelly suffered from sen bernie sanders ivt still being on the ballot and from evers’s latebreaking decision to try to postpone the election ad ad “in november against hapless joe biden president trump will win wisconsin again as he did in 2016” murtaugh said the republican national committee congratulated the president for winning the state’s uncontested republican presidential primary but made no mention of the court race top democratic strategists meanwhile said the chaos in wisconsin highlighted the need for additional voter protections before november’s vote “last week republicans did everything they could to prevent wisconsin voters from participating in the election” said marc elias a dcbased democratic elections lawyer “the rnc literally went to the us supreme court to try to stop the counting of mailed ballots if they were willing to do this to win a state supreme court seat imagine what they will do in november” ad ad former vice president joe biden beat sanders in the wisconsin democratic primary sanders dropped out of the race the day after the wisconsin vote and endorsed biden earlier monday in 2016 sanders decisively won the wisconsin primary carrying seven of the state’s eight congressional districts he also scored an upset victory in michigan and landslide win in minnesota’s caucuses

jvh1p2,2020-11-17 00:44:35,Democrats,Facebook Charged Biden a Higher Price Than Trump for Campaign Ads – The Markup,https://themarkup.org/election-2020/2020/10/29/facebook-political-ad-targeting-algorithm-prices-trump-biden,shadypat,1749,54,in swing states biden paid average ad rates of 34 compared with trump’s average of 17 in july and august by jeremy b merrill when president donald trump wanted to reach out to older arizona voters in august with the message “the radical left has taken over joe biden and the democratic party” with photos of bernie sanders alexandria ocasiocortez and ilhan omar facebook charged his campaign an estimated 14 for each 1000 times the advertisement appeared in people’s feeds a few days later biden targeted that same demographic with a message of his own that he had a plan to expand medicare and cut drug prices but facebook charged him a very different price—an estimated 91 per 1000 views of his ad more than six times what trump’s ad had cost that price difference wasn’t an anomaly the markup analyzed every known trump and biden ad purchased between july 1 2020 and oct 13 2020 and found that facebook has charged the presidential nominees wildly varying prices for their ads with biden paying on average nearly 250 more per 1000 impressions than trump the difference was especially stark in advertisements aimed primarily at facebook users in swing states in july and august where biden’s campaign paid an average of 3434 per 1000 views more than double trump’s average of 1655 during that period biden also paid more for ads that ran nationally and in other states—an average of 2855 to trump’s 2035 trump’s price advantage in swing states disappeared in september when the campaigns paid roughly similar prices in october facebook began charging biden slightly less than trump however over the course of tens of thousands of advertisements placed since july biden’s higher average price means he has paid over 8 million more for his facebook ads than he would have if he had been paying trump’s average price the sort of differential pricing for political advertising that the markup found would be illegal or unconventional in other media federal laws require tv stations to charge candidates the same price—the lowest that they charge any advertiser—for ads some states forbid newspaper publishers to charge one candidate a higher price digital strategists and campaign finance experts worry that the obscure way that facebook determines what price to charge could give one side a leg up candidates who can figure out how to game facebook’s ad system “get an advantage that other candidates wouldn’t get—because it’s opaque” ann ravel a former democratic member of the federal election commission and current candidate for state senate in california told the markup the markup’s analysis is based on ads published by facebook’s ad library api and provided to the markup by the nyu ad observatory to calculate the cost per mille or cost per 1000 views also abbreviated cpm we estimated the spend and impressions for each ad as the midpoint of the range reported by facebook neither presidential campaign responded to the markup’s requests for comment facebook defended its fluctuating ad pricing to the markup “this article reflects a misunderstanding of how digital advertising works all ads from all advertisers compete fairly in the same auction ad pricing will vary based on the parameters set by the advertiser such as their targeting and bid strategy” joe osborne a facebook spokesperson told the markup in an emailed statement osborne did not dispute any of our findings ↩ link effective facebook advertising has become key to winning elections facebook ceo mark zuckerberg has estimated the platform will make 420 million on political ads this election cycle tv advertising for national and local races which is much more expensive is expected to total more than 7 billion collectively biden and trump have spent 183 million on advertising on facebook and instagram this year which said they would cut off selling new political ads this week as part of an effort to limit misinformation facebook’s microtargeting capabilities were little more than a curiosity in 2012 but since then the platform and its vast trove of user data have become a major part of campaign strategy to badger core supporters for donations and target specifically crafted messages to groups of undecided voters “their platform allows political campaigns to have broad reach into demographics like seniors and suburban women that are particularly valuable audiences in 2020” regan opel a former republican political consultant who now works with progressive clients told the markup she also cited facebook’s “list matching capabilities that give us the precision needed to reach communities that have historically been underrepresented in politics” trump’s surprise victory in 2016 has been attributed to his campaign’s use of facebook for raising money energizing supporters and “attempts to deter” clinton supporters through microtargeted negative ads one prominent facebook executive said in an internal memo that trump “ran the single best digital ad campaign i’ve ever seen from any advertiser” after the 2016 election officials from both the trump and clinton campaigns said trump consistently got lower prices on facebook ads facebook however published a chart that it said showed trump paying slightly higher prices trump has paid less for his facebook ads though that price advantage has recently disappeared average weekly cost for 1000 ad impressions july 1 to oct 13 2020 source facebook ad library via nyu ad observatory google severely restricted its microtargeting choices for political ads last year eliminating the ability to target voters based on their political affiliation or voting record in response to controversy over misinformation the candidates still bought 158 million worth of ads from that company this year according to the search and video giant’s political ads transparency reports those reports don’t provide sufficiently granular data to calculate cpms though google uses auctions and “quality” algorithms to set prices too the company didn’t respond to a request for comment ↩ link facebook’s pricing decisions are opaque but experts say they favor “controversial” content campaigns get charged through the same opaque complex pricing mechanism as other advertisers whether political or commercial a splitsecond automated auction with other factors playing a role including subsidies for ads that an algorithm rates as more “relevant” the auction pits potential advertisers against one another each time a user is shown an ad which means higher prices for ads targeting people whose attention is in greater demand in the thick of the campaign voters in swing states who candidates think might be persuadable are some of the most valuable expensive targets “you’re competing against every other person there will be an overlap between who the trump campaign and the biden campaign and all these corporate brands are talking to” annie levene a democratic digital campaign expert told the markup join the next 100 help us celebrate publishing 100 articles and become one of our next 100 donors donate now digital strategists have made careers out of excavating the black box that is facebook’s advertising system and gaming it to their clients’ advantage several told the markup that in their experience the makeup of the target audience—both who is in it and how big it is—is a major factor in ad pricing our analysis found instances where identical ads targeted at different audiences had very different prices for instance one of biden’s cheapest ads promised “access to affordable quality health care for everyone” to an audience of minnesotans in midseptember facebook showed it for an estimated price of 230 per 1000 views a week later an identical ad was shown to onethird as many floridians but cost far more—a cost of 129 per 1000 impressions facebook charged biden 150 per thousand impressions of a “your prescriptions shouldn’t empty your wallet” video ad which went to seniors disproportionately in florida in early september it was one of biden’s most expensive facebook’s algorithm also favors “relevance” and based on predictions made by its machinelearning algorithms subsidizes ads that facebook considers more relevant relevance as facebook defines it is a function of facebook’s estimate of the rate at which people engage with the ad and facebook’s judgment of the ad’s “quality” facebook doesn’t disclose the advertiser’s target audience for the ads nor does it disclose how its algorithms rate the ad’s relevance so it’s impossible to say how much of an ad’s ultimate price was the product of its target audience and how much was due to subsidies by facebook osborne didn’t respond to the markup’s question as to whether facebook has checked for algorithmic bias political or otherwise in its relevance algorithms in 2018 a facebook executive tweeted that the benefit of the subsidies was “on the order of 10” but facebook’s opacity doesn’t stop the campaigns from guessing what is inside the black box eric wilson a republican digital strategist has noticed a trend “the ads perform better if they drive more engagement and interaction on the platform” wilson said “if you’re a campaign tapping into more relevant and timely and engaging topics which we should always read as controversial then you’re going to get a better ad rate” he said facebook’s ad quality algorithms also analyze an ad’s content not just users’ reactions to it an apparent effect of these algorithms is that facebook charges more to show liberal ads to conservative facebook users or vice versa compared to showing liberal content to liberals according to a northeastern university study responding to that study osborne told the washington post last year “ads should be relevant to the people who see them it’s always the case that campaigns can reach the audiences they want with the right targeting objective and spend” ↩ link political advertising is regulated—just not as tightly on digital platforms ravel the former member of the federal election commission said that if facebook is favoring controversial ads—and charging less for them—“that’s problematic for our democracy” some digital strategists have called for tighter regulations on advertising on digital platforms “that’s the real scandal of all of this in every other industry candidates pay the same rate i can’t go out to a tv station and get a better rate because my ad’s better produced” wilson said for now charging candidates different prices for online ads is legal “if the ad pricing mechanism is established based on facebook’s own business practices and some candidates are better at exploiting the pricing mechanism than others” then it wouldn’t be an illegal inkind contribution brendan fischer an attorney with nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog group campaign legal center told the markup the calls for regulation go beyond price disparities in advertising unlike advertising on tv ads on facebook and google are not subject to federal transparency laws that require disclaimers and disclosure of expenditure amounts wilson the republican strategist has proposed that facebook change its rules for candidates he told the markup “ensure that they’re paying the same amount to reach the same voters”

level it shows just how hollow the conservative project in america has become the proximate cause of ryan stepping down is that his party looks increasingly likely to suffer an electoral disaster in november’s midterm elections he is facing an unusually strong challenge from randy bryce the likely democratic nominee in his wisconsin district so he probably calculated that there were two realistic outcomes for him the worse one would be that he is defeated while his party loses the majority as happened to thenspeaker thomas s foley dwash in 1994 the better one would be that he holds on to his seat while republicans lose the majority which might not be better at all being speaker may have meant plenty of headaches for ryan but being house minority leader is a total drag you still have to manage your unruly caucus but you have no real power and can’t make any progress on your agenda nevertheless ryan might have decided to stick around he’s only 48 years old and even if republicans lose congress this year they’ll take it back eventually and then he could get back to pursuing all those important conservative goals right ad ad ah but there’s the problem and the reason ryan’s decision

nothing and he has now decided that there is nothing more to do during his news conference this morning ryan explained his departure this way “i have accomplished much of what i came here to do and my kids aren’t getting any younger” so what did he accomplish for years ryan has presented himself as someone deeply concerned with fiscal discipline committed to getting america’s books in order as anyone with any sense realized this was a scam like all republicans he used the deficit as a bludgeon against democratic presidents then forgot all about it while a republican was in office ad ad at the same time ryan — a lifelong admirer of ayn rand the philosopher of selfishness — dreamed of destroying the safety net eviscerating medicaid privatizing medicare slashing food stamps and generally making life in america more cruel and unpleasant for all those who aren’t wealthy but as paul krugman observed ryan failed at both his pretend goal and his real goal he will leave office after setting the deficit on a path to exceed 1 trillion in 2020 and yet he failed to repeal the affordable care act and didn’t even bother to wage an assault on medicare almost certainly because he knew how disastrous it would be for his party so what does he mean when he says “i have accomplished much of what i came here to do” he can only mean the tax cut republicans passed last year in other words engineering a giant giveaway to corporations and the wealthy was enough for ryan to say “my work here is done” ad ad and so it is for the gop as a whole not that they don’t have some other things they’re hoping for and that the trump administration is working to carry out for instance they’re gutting the environmental protection agency completely stopping enforcement of rules meant to protect consumers from rapacious financial corporations attacking reproductive rights and bringing back the war on drugs but when it comes to legislation the republicans’ time in power has pretty much consisted of trying and failing to repeal the aca cutting taxes and calling it a day they waited ten years for this opportunity since the democrats took control of congress in the 2006 elections and that’s all they could come up with they’ve made quite clear there will be no more major legislation between now and november’s midterms and if they lose the house and perhaps the senate there will be no more at all conservatives will have a few things to show for this period of absolute control of the federal government especially a large group of federal judges president trump has appointed but given how high their hopes were for a legislative revolution it’s a pathetic record don’t forget that all during 2016 republicans — none more so than ryan — said that despite the fact that their voters nominated a vulgar infantile corrupt buffoon to lead their party they simply had to stand by him because they wanted the chance to pass all that conservative legislation and have it signed by a republican president but now that corporations got their tax cut it was all worth it right ad ad paul ryan was always a fraud he pretended to be a wonk’s wonk but his budget and policy plans were full of sleightofhand and magic asterisks that fell apart on the most superficial examination he pretended to be terribly worried about the deficit but he happily jacked it up when he got the chance he pretended to care deeply about the poor but would have made their lives impossibly more miserable had doing so been politically tenable

president donald trump’s refusal this week to say if he would accept the results of november’s election and his repeated assertions that the vote will be “rigged” because of mailin ballots have raised the specter of a disputed election that could take weeks or even months to resolve file photo stickers saying i voted today are given out to voters in the democratic primary in philadelphia pennsylvania us june 2 2020 reutersrachel wisniewskifile photo even absent allegations of fraud the deluge of mail ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic could take weeks to tally making it less likely a winner is declared on election day in the contest between trump and democrat joe biden the former vice president currently leads trump in opinion polls here are some of the messy scenarios at play – and how they might unfold mailin ballots mail ballots will likely cause significant delays in tallying results in many states they can arrive after election day and officials must open them by hand and verify signatures already this year some primary elections held mostly by mail because of the pandemic have remained unsettled for weeks after election day democrats worry such delays could allow claims of fraud to gain traction a person briefed by the biden campaign said the candidate’s staff was bracing for a “nightmare scenario” in which trump declares victory based on leading the inperson vote count in battleground states on nov 3 but in the ensuing days as mailin ballots from densely populated urban areas are counted his advantage disappears in what experts call the “blue shift” and the president claims the contest is being stolen from him the courts states have varying laws regarding mailin and absentee ballots signature matching postmark requirements application deadlines and any could prompt litigation by either democrats or republicans over which ballots should be eligible and which should not presidential nominating contests held this year also exposed massive challenges in delivering mail ballots on time as election officials and post offices were overwhelmed by the surge voters who follow their state’s rules but cannot get their ballots back in time through no fault of their own could be effectively disenfranchised that could spark legal challenges in states where the race is decided by slim margins litigation filed in individual states could eventually reach the us supreme court as it did in 2000 when republican george w bush prevailed over democrat al gore by just 537 votes in florida after the conservativeleaning high court halted a recount the current court’s conservative majority has generally been permissive of voting restrictions but that does not necessarily suggest the court would lean toward trump in a dispute over the election results legal scholars say electoral college perhaps even more worrisome than litigation is the possibility of an electoral college dispute some experts say the us president is not actually elected by a majority of the popular vote under the constitution 538 electors – known as the electoral college – determine the winner in practice the candidate who wins each state’s popular vote typically collects that state’s electors which are apportioned based on population the governor of each state certifies the electors’ vote which takes place this year on dec 14 and submits it to congress for its approval in a new book “will he go” amherst college law professor lawrence douglas outlined a scenario in which the results in three swing states – michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania – are so close and muddied that both sides claim victory the republicancontrolled legislatures in each state egged on by trump submit their own certificates awarding the electors’ votes to trump even as the states’ democratic governors send separate certificates giving biden the votes states have occasionally submitted competing certificates in us history most notably in 1876 when the election remained unsettled for months the dispute was resolved only after officials from both parties brokered a deal giving republican rutherford b hayes the presidency in exchange for withdrawing us troops left over from the civil war from southern states a move that helped usher in the jim crow era of racial segregation the supreme court recently ruled that states could punish “faithless electors” who cast votes for someone other than the winner of their state but more than a dozen states have no rules against faithless electors under the federal electoral count act congress is responsible for resolving electoral college disputes not the supreme court but the law is ambiguous douglas said and if the senate remains in the hands of republicans and democrats keep control of the house of representatives a split congress may not easily agree on a solution “if you ask whether our constitutional legal system is designed to deal with an electoral crisis the answer is it really isn’t” douglas said in an interview military to escort him out some experts said they were most concerned about the lasting damage to democratic norms if trump refuses to concede defeat even if biden is declared the winner peaceful succession is a hallmark of us democracy the supreme court’s ruling in bush v gore did not end the election gore’s decision to accept it did biden has suggested the military might need to “escort” trump out of the white house if he loses but refuses to leave whoever is sworn in as president on jan 20 will command both the armed forces as well as executivebranch security agencies like the secret service a disputed election could also spark civil unrest in a country already on edge thanks to the coronavirus the recession and months of demonstrations over racial injustice mark brewer an elections lawyer who is helping train democratic legal volunteers in michigan said the best way to avoid an extended legal battle would be for biden to win by a wide margin “democrats have to make sure this election is not close” he said

washington post president trump revealed highly classified information to the russian foreign minister and ambassador in a white house meeting last week according to current and former us officials who said trump’s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the islamic state the information the president relayed had been provided by a us partner through an intelligencesharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the us government officials said the partner had not given the united states permission to share the material with russia and officials said trump’s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the islamic state after trump’s meeting senior white house officials took steps to contain the damage placing calls to the cia and the national security agency “this is codeword information” said a us official familiar with the matter using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by american spy agencies trump “revealed more information to the russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies” bastien inzaurraldemonica akhtarthe washington post lawmakers express shock and concern about trump disclosure of classified information the revelation comes as the president faces rising legal and political pressure on multiple russiarelated fronts last week he fired fbi director james b comey in the midst of a bureau investigation into possible links between the trump campaign and moscow trump’s subsequent admission that his decision was driven by “this russia thing” was seen by critics as attempted obstruction of justice one day after dismissing comey trump welcomed russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and ambassador sergey kislyak — a key figure in earlier russia controversies — into the oval office it was during that meeting officials said that trump went off script and began describing details of an islamic state terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft for almost anyone in government discussing such matters with an adversary would be illegal as president trump has broad authority to declassify government secrets making it unlikely that his disclosures broke the law white house officials involved in the meeting said trump discussed only shared concerns about terrorism “the president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation” said hr mcmaster the national security adviser who participated in the meeting “at no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly” mcmaster reiterated his statement in a subsequent appearance at the white house on monday and described the washington post story as “false” but did not take any questions in their statements white house officials emphasized that trump had not discussed specific intelligence sources and methods rather than addressing whether he had disclosed information drawn from sensitive sources the cia declined to comment and the nsa did not respond to requests for comment but officials expressed concern about trump’s handling of sensitive information as well as his grasp of the potential consequences exposure of an intelligence stream that has provided critical insight into the islamic state they said could hinder the united states’ and its allies’ ability to detect future threats on russia trump and his top national security aides seem to be at odds “it is all kind of shocking” said a former senior us official who is close to current administration officials “trump seems to be very reckless and doesn’t grasp the gravity of the things he’s dealing with especially when it comes to intelligence and national security and it’s all clouded because of this problem he has with russia” in his meeting with lavrov trump seemed to be boasting about his inside knowledge of the looming threat “i get great intel i have people brief me on great intel every day” the president said according to an official with knowledge of the exchange trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the united states learned only through the espionage capabilities of a key partner he did not reveal the specific intelligencegathering method but he described how the islamic state was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances most alarmingly officials said trump revealed the city in the islamic state’s territory where the us intelligence partner detected the threat the washington post the post is withholding most plot details including the name of the city at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities “everyone knows this stream is very sensitive and the idea of sharing it at this level of granularity with the russians is troubling” said a former senior us counterterrorism official who also worked closely with members of the trump national security team he and others spoke on the condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of the subject the identification of the location was seen as particularly problematic officials said because russia could use that detail to help identify the us ally or intelligence capability involved officials said the capability could be useful for other purposes possibly providing intelligence on russia’s presence in syria moscow would be keenly interested in identifying that source and perhaps disrupting it political chaos in washington is a return on investment in moscow russia and the united states both regard the islamic state as an enemy and share limited information about terrorist threats but the two nations have competing agendas in syria where moscow has deployed military assets and personnel to support president bashar alassad “russia could identify our sources or techniques” the senior us official said a former intelligence official who handled highlevel intelligence on russia said that given the clues trump provided “i don’t think that it would be that hard for russian spy services to figure this out” at a more fundamental level the information wasn’t the united states’ to provide to others under the rules of espionage governments — and even individual agencies — are given significant control over whether and how the information they gather is disseminated even after it has been shared violating that practice undercuts trust considered essential to sharing secrets the officials declined to identify the ally but said it has previously voiced frustration with washington’s inability to safeguard sensitive information related to iraq and syria “if that partner learned we’d given this to russia without their knowledge or asking first that is a blow to that relationship” the us official said trump also described measures the united states has taken or is contemplating to counter the threat including military operations in iraq and syria as well as other steps to tighten security officials said the officials would not discuss details of those measures but the department of homeland security recently disclosed that it is considering banning laptops and other large electronic devices from carryon bags on flights between europe and the united states the united states and britain imposed a similar ban in march affecting travelers passing through airports in 10 muslimmajority countries trump cast the countermeasures in wistful terms “can you believe the world we live in today” he said according to one official “isn’t it crazy” lavrov and kislyak were also accompanied by aides a russian photographer took photos of part of the session that were released by the russian stateowned tass news agency no us news organization was allowed to attend any part of the meeting senior white house officials appeared to recognize quickly that trump had overstepped and moved to contain the potential fallout thomas p bossert assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism placed calls to the directors of the cia and the nsa the services most directly involved in the intelligencesharing arrangement with the partner one of bossert’s subordinates also called for the problematic portion of trump’s discussion to be stricken from internal memos and for the full transcript to be limited to a small circle of recipients efforts to prevent sensitive details from being disseminated further or leaked white house officials defended trump “this story is false” said dina powell deputy national security adviser for strategy “the president only discussed the common threats that both countries faced” but officials could not explain why staff members nevertheless felt it necessary to alert the cia and the nsa sen bob corker rtenn said he would rather comment on the revelations in the post story after “i know a little bit more about it” but added “obviously they are in a downward spiral right now and have got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that’s happening and the shame of it is there’s a really good national security team in place” corker also said “the chaos that is being created by the lack of discipline is creating an environment that i think makes — it creates a worrisome environment” trump has repeatedly gone offscript in his dealings with highranking foreign officials most notably in his contentious introductory conversation with the australian prime minister earlier this year he has also faced criticism for seemingly lax attention to security at his florida retreat maralago where he appeared to field preliminary reports of a north korea missile launch in full view of casual diners us officials said that the national security council continues to prepare multipage briefings for trump to guide him through conversations with foreign leaders but that he has insisted that the guidance be distilled to a single page of bullet points — and often ignores those “he seems to get in the room or on the phone and just goes with it and that has big downsides” the second former official said “does he understand what’s classified and what’s not that’s what worries me” lavrov’s reaction to the trump disclosures was muted officials said calling for the united states to work more closely with moscow on fighting terrorism kislyak has figured prominently in damaging stories about the trump administration’s ties to russia trump’s first national security adviser michael flynn was forced to resign just 24 days into the job over his contacts with kislyak and his misleading

president donald trump making him only the third president to be charged with high crimes and misdemeanors and face a senate trial that could remove him from office the largely partyline vote after eight hours of highly charged partisan debate represented the culmination of a sprawling threemonth investigation that was conducted by multiple committees in the democraticcontrolled house and was opposed at every turn by the white house and congressional republicans following wednesdays votes white house press secretary stephanie grisham called the impeachment an unconstitutional travesty trump she said in a statement is confident the senate will restore regular order fairness and due process and he is prepared for the next steps and confident that he will be fully exonerated after the votes a somber house speaker nancy pelosi paid tribute to the late rep elijah cummings of maryland who was among the democratic leaders of the antitrump effort until his death at age 68 on oct 17 he said when the history books are written about this tumultuous era i want them to show that i was among those in the house of representatives who stood up to lawlessness and tyranny pelosi said he also

chairman jerry nadler cl hold a press conference after the house passed resolution 755 articles of impeachment against president donald j trump at the us capitol in washington dc on december 18 2019 olivier douliery afp getty images article one abuse of power was adopted by 230 to 197 with one member voting present article two obstruction of congress passed by 229 to 198 with one voting present two democrats broke ranks and voted against impeachment on the first article one of them was rep colin peterson dminn who represents a district that trump won easily in 2016 and who had faced pressure for months to oppose the impeachment the other was new jersey rep jeff van drew who is expected to switch parties and join the republican caucus van drew and peterson had consistently voted against allowing the impeachment probe to move forward in procedural votes this fall a third democratic lawmaker rep jared golden of maine joined peterson and van drew on wednesday to vote against the second article of impeachment obstruction of congress golden did support passage of the first article for abuse of power ultimately trump was impeached on two specific charges the first was that he abused his power by freezing us foreign aid to ukraine in order to pressure ukraines president into launching investigations into trumps domestic political opponents according to the first article of impeachment trumps actions toward ukraine amounted to having used his office to solicit the interference of a foreign government ukraine in the 2020 united states presidential election through his conduct the article asserts trump demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the constitution if allowed to remain in office and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with selfgovernance and the rule of law the second article charges trump with obstruction of congress for demanding that top level staffers at the white house defy the lawfully issued subpoenas they received from the house intelligence committee compelling them to testify in the impeachment probe president trump thus interposed the powers of the presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the house of representatives the article states and he assumed to himself functions and judgments that are the constitutional purview of the legislative branch and specifically of the house despite the white houses blanket directive to aides this fall not to testify more than a dozen current and former national security officials diplomats and career public servants ignored the presidents instructions and opted to give testimony under oath collectively the officials described how trump and his personal attorney rudy giuliani engaged in a monthslong effort for force ukraine to agree to actions that ran contrary to us national security priorities instead of working in the best interests of the united states the officials said trumps lieutenants were dispatched around the world to

assailed and insulted the lawmakers leading the probe the reporters covering it and the government employees testifying in it trump has insisted that a july 25 phone call he had with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy in which he asked for the investigations as a favor was perfect and that the entire impeachment effort is part of a personal vendetta against him and a desire by

interfering in americas elections trump wrote in the sixpage screed you are the ones subverting americas democracy you are the ones obstructing justice you are the ones bringing pain and suffering to

it9yo9,2020-09-15 17:34:34,Democrats,Scientific American Endorses Joe Biden; We’ve never backed a presidential candidate in our 175-year history—until now,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientific-american-endorses-joe-biden/,progress18,1538,64,scientific american has never endorsed a presidential candidate in its 175year history this year we are compelled to do so we do not do this lightly the evidence and the science show that donald trump has badly damaged the us and its people—because he rejects evidence and science the most devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the covid19 pandemic which cost more than 190000 americans their lives by the middle of september he has also attacked environmental protections medical care and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges that is why we urge you to vote for joe biden who is offering factbased plans to protect our health our economy and the environment these and other proposals he has put forth can set the country back on course for a safer more prosperous and more equitable future the pandemic would strain any nation and system but trumps rejection of evidence and public health measures have been catastrophic in the us he was warned many times in january and february about the onrushing disease yet he did not develop a national strategy to provide protective equipment coronavirus testing or clear health guidelines testing people for the virus and tracing those they may have infected is how countries in europe and asia have gained control over their outbreaks saved lives and successfully reopened businesses and schools but in the us trump claimed falsely that “anybody that wants a test can get a test” that was untrue in march and remained untrue through the summer trump opposed 25 billion for increased testing and tracing that was in a pandemic relief bill as late as july these lapses accelerated the spread of disease through the country—particularly in highly vulnerable communities that include people of color where deaths climbed disproportionately to those in the rest of the population it wasnt just a testing problem if almost everyone in the us wore masks in public it could save about 66000 lives by the beginning of december according to projections from the university of washington school of medicine such a strategy would hurt no one it would close no business it would cost next to nothing but trump and his vice president flouted local mask rules making it a point not to wear masks themselves in public appearances trump has openly supported people who ignored governors in michigan and california and elsewhere as they tried to impose social distancing and restrict public activities to control the virus he encouraged governors in florida arizona and texas who resisted these public health measures saying in april—again falsely—that “the worst days of the pandemic are behind us” and ignoring infectious disease experts who warned at the time of a dangerous rebound if safety measures were loosened and of course the rebound came with cases across the nation rising by 46 percent and deaths increasing by 21 percent in june the states that followed trumps misguidance posted new daily highs and higher percentages of positive tests than those that did not by early july several hospitals in texas were full of covid19 patients states had to close up again at tremendous economic cost about 31 percent of workers were laid off a second time following the giant wave of unemployment—more than 30 million people and countless shuttered businesses—that had already decimated the country at every stage trump has rejected the unmistakable lesson that controlling the disease not downplaying it is the path to economic reopening and recovery trump repeatedly lied to the public about the deadly threat of the disease saying it was not a serious concern and “this is like a flu​” when he knew it was more lethal and highly transmissible according to his taped statements to journalist bob woodward his lies encouraged people to engage in risky behavior spreading the virus further and have driven wedges between americans who take the threat seriously and those who believe trumps falsehoods the white house even produced a memo attacking the expertise of the nations leading infectious disease physician anthony fauci in a despicable attempt to sow further distrust trumps reaction to americas worst public health crisis in a century has been to say “i dont take responsibility at all” instead he blamed other countries and his white house predecessor who left office three years before the pandemic began but trumps refusal to look at the evidence and act accordingly extends beyond the virus he has repeatedly tried to get rid of the affordable care act while offering no alternative comprehensive medical insurance is essential to reduce illness trump has proposed billiondollar cuts to the national institutes of health the national science foundation and the centers for disease control and prevention agencies that increase our scientific knowledge and strengthen us for future challenges congress has countermanded his reductions yet he keeps trying slashing programs that would ready us for future pandemics and withdrawing from the world health organization these and other actions increase the risk that new diseases will surprise and devastate us again trump also keeps pushing to eliminate health rules from the environmental protection agency putting people at more risk for heart and lung disease caused by pollution he has replaced scientists on agency advisory boards with industry representatives in his ongoing denial of reality trump has hobbled us preparations for climate change falsely claiming that it does not exist and pulling out of international agreements to mitigate it the changing climate is already causing a rise in heatrelated deaths and an increase in severe storms wildfires and extreme flooding joe biden in contrast comes prepared with plans to control covid19 improve health care reduce carbon emissions and restore the role of legitimate science in policy making he solicits expertise and has turned that knowledge into solid policy proposals on covid19 he states correctly that “it is wrong to talk about ‘choosing between our public health and our economy if we dont beat the virus we will never get back to full economic strength” biden plans to ramp up a national testing board a body that would have the authority to command both public and private resources to supply more tests and get them to all communities he also wants to establish a public health job corps of 100000 people many of whom have been laid off during the pandemic crisis to serve as contact tracers and in other health jobs he will direct the occupational health and safety administration to enforce workplace safety standards to avoid the kind of deadly outbreaks that have occurred at meatprocessing plants and nursing homes while trump threatened to withhold money from school districts that did not reopen regardless of the danger from the virus biden wants to spend 34 billion to help schools conduct safe inperson instruction as well as remote learning biden is getting advice on these public health issues from a group that includes david kessler epidemiologist pediatrician and former us food and drug administration chief rebecca katz immunologist and global health security specialist at georgetown university and ezekiel emanuel bioethicist at the university of pennsylvania it does not include physicians who believe in aliens and debunked virus therapies one of whom trump has called “very respected” and “spectacular” biden has a family and caregiving initiative recognizing this as key to a sustained public health and economic recovery his plans include increased salaries for child care workers and construction of new facilities for children because the inability to afford quality care keeps workers out of the economy and places enormous strains on families on the environment and climate change biden wants to spend 2 trillion on an emissionsfree power sector by 2035 build energyefficient structures and vehicles push solar and wind power establish research agencies to develop safe nuclear power and carbon capture technologies and more the investment will produce two million jobs for us workers his campaign claims and the climate plan will be partly paid by eliminating trumps corporate tax cuts historically disadvantaged communities in the us will receive 40 percent of these energy and infrastructure benefits it is not certain how many of these and his other ambitions biden will be able to accomplish much depends on laws to be written and passed by congress but he is acutely aware that we must heed the abundant research showing ways to recover from our present crises and successfully cope with future challenges although trump and his allies have tried to create obstacles that prevent people from casting ballots safely in november either by mail or in person it is crucial that we surmount them and vote its time to move trump out and elect biden who has a record of following the data and being guided by science editor’s note 91520 this article has been edited after its publication in the october 2020 issue of scientific american to reflect recent reporting

industries planned aluminum rolling mill in eastern kentucky was identified as a proxy of the kremlin in a new report the senate intelligence committee released this week the russian firm united co rusal agreed last year to invest 200 million in the mill which is expected to create hundreds of longterm jobs in a struggling region of the state if braidy is able to raise enough financing to build the facility which will cost well over 15 billion the republicanled senate committee released a report tuesday that detailed extensive connections between president donald trumps 2016 campaign advisers and people with ties to russian president vladimir putins regime and it points to russian oligarch oleg deripaska — a partowner of rusal which is a major aluminum company that operates internationally — as a key figure the senate committees report which examines russian efforts to interfere in americas 2016 presidential election says deripaskas companies including rusal are proxies for the kremlin including for russian government influence efforts economic measures and diplomatic relations the courier journal sent braidy industries a request for comment concerning the senate committees report it also asked about the status of rusals investment in the mill whether braidy intends to continue its business relationship with that firm and how braidys efforts to secure financing for the mill are proceeding top headlinesva hospital let neighbor illegally decide veterans fate report says braidy — which recently brought a new acting president and ceo don foster on board — responded through a spokeswoman with the following statement don foster is hard at work every day utilizing his expertise and expansive network built during his 40 years in the metals industry to finalize financing and build the mill in ashland ky a us securities and exchange commission report braidy filed in june said rusal had provided 75 million so far for the mill project as of dec 31 2019 but had discontinued further contributions until braidy secures another 300 million in funding kentuckys state government also has a financial stake in the mills future following a direct investment it made in braidy in 2017 state officials including gov andy beshear have said they hope the mill project will succeed and create job opportunities in the commonwealth morebraidy industries would bring hope and opportunity back to appalachia and kentucky the us government previously imposed sanctions on rusal and its parent company en group rusals decision to invest in braidys mill was announced in april 2019 a few months after the federal government lifted the sanctions against the russian firm several democrats in congress quickly expressed concern about the planned investment the us senate voted down a measure opposing the plan to end the sanctions against rusal and en group in january 2019 senate majority leader mitch mcconnell as well as sen rand paul both kentucky republicans voted against that attempt to keep the sanctions in place the kentucky democratic party on wednesday questioned mcconnells decision to support lifting the sanctions on rusal in light of the senate intelligence committee reports identification of rusal as a proxy for the kremlin earlierbraidy industries gave former 6 million to sever ties with company the democratic party also mentioned a 2019 politico report about how two people who used to work on mcconnells staff lobbied the federal government on braidys behalf party spokeswoman marisa mcnee said mcconnell needs to publicly explain what he knows concerning how rusal became a vital source of funds for a project that will be built in the state he has represented in congress for decades it’s time for moscow mitch to tell the truth to the people of kentucky there are just too many unanswered questions and too many people from mcconnell’s orbit who have been exposed as playing a big role in this deal for him to continue to play dumb mcnee said what did he know and when did he know it robert steurer a spokesman for mcconnell told the courier journal last year that the senator has said rusals investment in braidys mill did not play a role in his stance on the sanctions against the russian company and mcconnell told reporters in may 2019 that his decision to support lifting the sanctions was unrelated to anything that might happen in my home state steurer said in an email wednesday that previous comments mcconnell has made about rusal still stand he also referred the courier journal to a statement mcconnell released tuesday that praised the senate intelligence committees members for keeping their investigation out of the partisan spotlight and focused on the facts “the committee’s findings along with other information recently released by the intelligence community confirm what we already knew russia china iran and other foreign actors want to influence our politics interfere with our elections and stoke fear and division among americans mcconnell said see alsokentucky planning to implement a 400 unemployment supplement deripaska the rusal coowner pops up many times in the senate committees report the report says paul manafort — trumps former campaign chairman — worked for deripaska in the past and was in close contact with a russian intelligence officer konstantin kilimnik whom the report describes as having been manaforts primary liaison to deripaska the committee found that manaforts presence on the campaign and proximity to trump created opportunities for russian intelligence services to exert influence over and acquire confidential information on the trump campaign the report says taken as a whole manaforts highlevel access and willingness to share information with individuals closely affiliated with the russian intelligence services particularly kilimnik and associates of oleg deripaska represented a grave counterintelligence threat it also

according to the indictment kolfage a 37yearold triple amputee launched the crowdfunding campaign in late 2018 on gofundme to build the wall his effort came amid a stalemate over government funding on capitol hill where trump demanded that any spending package include billions of dollars to go toward the border barrier the deadlock culminated in the longest partial government shutdown in us history

izojm3,2020-09-25 21:05:47,Democrats,"The seven discarded Pennsylvania ballots Trump keeps harping about were (1) in the June primary and (2) lacking secrecy envelopes. The Trump campaign was the one that sued to require secrecy envelopes and won. Therefore, the ballots were discarded because of Trump's lawsuit.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/25/what-we-know-about-those-discarded-trump-ballots-pennsylvania/,wenchette,1496,46,it is not in other words the sort of place where you’d assume that democratic operatives would launch an effort to subvert the 2020 election yet over the past 24 hours that’s been the subtext to assertions made by the president the white house and the justice department — a subtext which by now seems almost entirely false the apparent first mention of a problem with ballots cast by military voters in the county came from president trump himself in a radio interview with fox news’s brian kilmeade ad ad “these ballots are a horror show” trump said continuing his longstanding — and false — claims about mailin ballots “they found six ballots in an office yesterday in a garbage can they were trump ballots — eight ballots in an office yesterday in — but in a certain state and they were — they had trump written on it and they were thrown in a garbage can” in part because the interview was not otherwise exceptional and in part because trump often makes similar claims without evidence this assertion didn’t attract much attention trump is said to have learned about the incident from attorney general william p barr according to a washington post report a few hours later though white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany elevated the issue ad “i can confirm for you that trump ballots ballots for the president were found in pennsylvania” mcenany said as part of her description of mailin voting being “a system that’s subject to fraud” ad “i believe you should be getting more information on that shortly” she continued “here in the last 24 hours they were found cast aside” more information was provided shortly — in the unusual form of a statement released by the justice department from the us attorney in the region “at this point we can confirm that a small number of military ballots were discarded” by county election officials it read “investigators have recovered nine ballots at this time some of those ballots can be attributed to specific voters and some cannot all nine ballots were cast for presidential candidate donald trump” ad in short order trump‘s reelection campaign seized on the report matt wolking the campaign’s deputy director of communications tweeted that “100 of the ballots were cast for president trump” adding that “democrats are trying to steal the election” ad he didn‘t note that there were only nine ballots under consideration or that the circumstances around their being discarded were unclear soon after the initial justice department statement was released it was corrected no longer were 100 percent of the ballots cast for trump “of the nine ballots that were discarded and then recovered 7 were cast for presidential candidate donald trump” the “revised statement” read “two of the discarded ballots had been resealed inside their appropriate envelopes by luzerne elections staff prior to recovery by the fbi and the contents of those 2 ballots are unknown” ad wolking later deleted his tweet “our inquiry remains ongoing and we expect later today to share our up to date findings with officials in luzerne county” the justice department’s new statement concluded “it is the vital duty of government to ensure that every properly cast vote is counted” ad those updated findings were also made public in the form of a letter published by the department in the fifth of its six paragraphs the us attorney outlined what was understood to have happened “our investigation has revealed that all or nearly all envelopes received in the elections office were opened as a matter of course” it read “it was explained to investigators the envelopes used for official overseas military absentee and mailin ballot requests are so similar that the staff believed that adhering to the protocol of preserving envelopes unopened would cause them to miss such ballot requests our interviews further revealed that this issue was a problem in the primary election — therefore a known issue — and that the problem has not been corrected” ad ryan godfrey an elections official in pennsylvania noted that the state’s process for issuing military ballots is different from that for other voters pennsylvania sends out writein ballots that can be sent and returned before the slate of candidates is finalized given that the state’s presidential candidate slate wasn’t finalized until the past week and the ballots were received in luzerne county on monday it’s probable that these writein ballots were what was at issue ad here’s where things may get a bit ironic because these ballots were returned in envelopes similar to absentee ballot requests elections officials opened them if the ballots weren’t then enclosed in another envelope that shielded the actual vote being cast they may have been considered “naked ballots” a term used to describe mail ballots returned without the voter’s intent being protected ad if that’s the case which again isn’t clear that meant that elections officials who were opening the envelopes to see what they contained may have had to discard the votes given a recent ruling by the state’s supreme court the associated press reported on that decision writing that the court’s extension of the period in which ballots could be returned was a win for democrats “in wins for republicans” the report continued the court “rejected requests to let voters who aren’t disabled give their mailin ballot to someone else to deliver to require counties to let voters fix disqualifying problems with their mailin ballots such as not signing their return envelope and to require counties to count mailedin ballots that arrive without a secrecy envelope” ad ad emphasis added those are the naked ballots lisa deeley a city commissioner in philadelphia sent a letter monday urging the state legislature to abandon the legal requirement for a secrecy envelope that prompted the court’s decision she warned that adhering to the court’s ruling could “cause electoral chaos” — a prediction that might have been rendered accurate even as the letter was being sent on friday afternoon luzerne county manager c david pedri released his own delineation of what happened according to pedri the county hired a temporary staffer as it usually does before an election on sept 14 that staffer “incorrectly discarded” ballots from military or overseas voters after county staffers learned about the ballots being discarded the county informed federal authorities secured trash from the dumpster and fired the temporary employee county staff local law enforcement and the fbi sorted through the trash to find any missing ballots ad ad “while the actions of this individual has cast a concern the above statement shows that the system of checks and balances set forth in pennsylvania elections works” pedri wrote “an error was made a public servant discovered it and reported it to law enforcement at the local state and federal level who took over to ensure the integrity of the system in place” his report added another detail too “luzerne county elections staff were unaware for whom the ballots were cast until the disclosure via press release of the united states attorney on september 24 2020” he wrote what’s most important to take away from this incident is that even after multiple updates we don’t yet know what happened despite trump’s insinuation that something untoward occurred and his campaign’s direct claim that democratic nefariousness was to blame there is not yet any proof that anything improper happened much less anything illegal ad what we have learned in fact isn’t that democrats are trying to rig the election it’s that the trump administration — including the justice department — and the trump campaign are willing to use sketchy allegations in an effort to undermine confidence in mailin voting that effort is itself part of an obvious move by the trump campaign to delegitimize valid ballots out of concern that those ballots will tend to favor trump’s opponent that’s why rejecting “naked ballots” was a win for trump’s team in the first place it would probably lead to more votes for democratic presidential nominee joe biden being thrown out in a pivotal swing state precisely the outcome trump’s party wanted that effort may have yielded the party the additional benefit of 24 hours spent in the nowfamiliar pattern of slathering a murky incident involving mailin ballots with insinuations about wrongdoing — insinuations that later prove to be unfounded

delivers his farewell address today at 100 pm et always had big ideas he called for the government to respond to the growing deficitdebt he advocated for a fundamental restructuring of medicare and entitlements he pushed for tax reform and he demanded an improvement in the nation’s political discourse “we shouldn’t accept ugliness as the norm” he said in his march 2016 speech during the heat of the gop presidential race but those ideas — except for tax reform — never really matched up to reality and party politics the debt and deficit he saw a “crisis” to reduce well it’s gone up in the trump years when ryan was speaker and the gop controlled government major entitlement reform hasn’t happened improving political discourse hello president trump ryan’s defenders say it’s difficult to continue to tackle the deficitdebt when the other players — especially the white house — aren’t interested no one they say is capable of reining in the president and his rhetoric and every speaker they argue is bound to the realities of what congress and the political system can produce but they also point out ryan’s achievements over the last two years overhauling the tax code sanctioning russia iran and north korea reforming the va passing legislation combating opioids and increasing military spending but what ryan didn’t achieve and where his past rhetoric fell short underscore the difference of being an ideas person like his idol jack kemp was versus a party leader like speaker of the house they also speak to how the republican party of the 1980s 1990s and early 2000s — emphasizing limited government and personality responsibility and morality — has changed in the trump era ryan’s retirement signals how trump’s wing of the party defeated ryan’s wing congress works to craft temporary spending bill through february to avoid a shutdown per nbc’s frank thorp and alex moe senate appropriations committee chairman richard shelby rala told reporters last night “we’re working” on drafting a continuing resolution cr until early february but that “ultimately it’s up to the leader” why punt until early february shelby said to give the “new democratic house time to organize to get settled in a little bit” thorp and moe add that both house and senate democrats are indicating they would not oppose a cr until early february two democratic sources tell nbc news so with congressional democrats seemingly onboard the biggest question now is would president donald trump sign another cr if it passes both chambers and avert a government shutdown friday he has said in the past he did not want to sign additional continuing resolutions senate passes criminal justice reform bill nbc’s rebecca shabad and phil helsel “the senate passed a huge criminal law reform bill on tuesday night seizing on bipartisan support for the broadest set of changes to federal crime statutes in a generation a rare coalition of conservatives liberals activists prosecutors and defense attorneys — spanning the political spectrum — pushed senators to pass the “first step act” by a final vote of 8712” “the house is expected to take up the senate version of the bill at a later date the house passed a similar version of the bill back in may by a wide margin 36059 president donald trump announced in november that he backs the legislation” trump foundation to dissolve after pressure from new york’s attorney general “the trump foundation — the charitable foundation started by president donald trump years before he became a presidential candidate which new yorks top prosecutor said exhibited a ‘shocking pattern of illegality’ — will dissolve under pressure from the states attorney general according to a court filing” per nbc’s tom winter hallie jackson and kristen welker “the foundation will give away its assets to other nonprofit organizations in the next 30 days according to an agreement between state prosecutors and the trump foundation according to an agreement reached between new york attorney general barbara underwood and the trump foundation” importantly “it does not stop the lawsuit the ag’s office has filed against the foundation which was formed in 1987 and that action will continue” republicans gamble on appointing mcsally to the senate it’s never happened before that a defeated senate candidate was immediately appointed to chamber to serve alongside the elected senator that beat himher but here we are on tuesday per nbc’s ben kamisar arizona gov steve ducey appointed rep martha mcsally rariz to fill the seat vacated by the late sen john mccain by way of jon kyl who filled the seat for three months after mccain’s death and of course mcsally lost to incoming democratic sen kirsten sinema last month 50 percent to 48 percent ducey and the gop are definitely taking a gamble on mcsally who will have several challenges to confront as she tries to keep the seat in gop hands in 2020 prove herself to arizona voters after 50 percent voted for someone else protect herself from a credible primary challenge from the right navigate being a republican in the trump era and prepare for a top contest from the democrats in november 2020 when the electorate won’t be fundamentally different from what we saw last november then again who was going to be a better candidate for republicans mcsally after all is an outgoing gop congresswoman her military service made history and she’s run in plenty of tough races before the questions we have who are the democrats going to find to run against her and can the dems avoid a primary like sinema was able to in 2018 add michael bennet to the dem 2020 list yahoo’s jon ward “sen michael bennet dcolo confirmed in an interview tuesday that he is considering a run for president ‘i am thinking about it’ bennet

parkland “whatever you need whatever we can do to ease your pain” he went on “we must also work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life that creates deep and meaningful human connections and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors” because if there’s anything we know about trump it’s that he cares about creating deep and meaningful human connections ad ad let’s return to earth if we actually want to do something about gun violence both the dramatic mass shootings and the relentless toll of 30 or so gun homicides we experience each and every day there is something we can do it’s simple and straightforward are you ready here it is don’t vote for republicans i’m sorry if you find that too partisan and i realize that there are many reasons you might have for voting for candidates of one or the other party that have nothing to do with guns but the fact is that one of our two parties has in recent years decided that it will stop any and all efforts to address gun violence no matter how reasonable they are and no matter how much of the public favors them even something like universal background checks that is supported by more than 90 percent of americans ad ad so if you vote for republicans you are voting to make sure we do absolutely nothing about this problem a problem that kills around 30000 americans every year you might say “that’s not what i’m voting for i’m voting for low taxes and less regulation and restrictive abortion laws” sorry you may be voting for those other things too but if you vote for republicans you are most certainly voting to make sure we do nothing about gun violence this is a reality that we seem to have trouble saying plainly conservatives sometimes complain that on the gun issue journalists let their biases show through which is a legitimate criticism insofar as many in the media do in fact become emotional when they see a bunch of children brutally murdered terribly unprofessional i know but the truth is that they also go to absurd lengths to avoid saying anything that might sound too partisan again and again in the aftermath of these massacres media figures lament that “washington” and “politicians” and “congress” can’t seem to get it together to act but it is republicans who have stopped any attempt to address gun violence not the city of washington not the system not the institutions — republicans the senate doesn’t filibuster every gun safety bill — republicans do the house doesn’t refuse to allow those bills to come to a vote — republican leaders do washington didn’t pass a bill last year making it easier for people with mental illnesses to buy guns — republicans in congress did and trump signed it ad ad but isn’t the nra the real problem no the nra is made up of loathsome ghouls but it’s also an interest group like any other doing its bidding is a choice whatever power the nra has flows through elected officials nearly all of whom are republicans who have made a choice to ally themselves with the organization and don’t tell me that the nra is just too powerful to stand up to it isn’t it’s like any other interest group that tries to influence elections in good years for its favored party its candidates win while in bad years for its favored party its candidates lose the nra can be beaten and all it takes is for people who don’t agree with its goals to get out and vote just to be clear i’m not saying that voting for democrats will in and of itself solve the gun violence problem while their hearts are in the right place generally speaking on this issue democrats are often feckless and cowardly at least some of them because they’re politicians they have to be pushed and prodded and made to fear for their jobs if you want them to do the right thing some of the policy changes they propose will be more complicated to implement than others and some will be more effective than others ad ad but while voting for democrats is no guarantee that we’ll begin to solve the gun violence problem voting for republicans is a stonecold absolute ironclad 100 percent guarantee that we won’t the gop wasn’t always implacably opposed to any sensible action on guns and perhaps at some point in the future it will no longer be but it is now and maybe you think that periodically watching a bunch of schoolchildren get massacred is a reasonable price to pay for the glorious freedom that can be obtained only through owning an ar15 or maybe you think that the other things you get from voting republican like tax cuts or rollbacks in environmental protections are so important that they outweigh any considerations about guns
cp1nth,2019-08-11 23:09:40,Democrats,Trump Won Because Of Lower Democratic Turnout. No Matter Who Wins The Nomination... Vote!,https://www.forbes.com/sites/omribenshahar/2016/11/17/the-non-voters-who-decided-the-election-trump-won-because-of-lower-democratic-turnout/#400c246e53ab,Anticipator1234,1454,77,an astonishing spectacle of the election aftermath is the false account of why trump won the accepted wisdom is that trump succeeded in awakening a popular movement of anger and frustration among white bluecollar less educated mostly male voters particularly in nonurban areas trump promised them jobs safe borders and dignity and they responded by turning out in masses at his preelection rallies and eventually at the ballots carrying him to victory this story is mostly wrong trump did not win because he was more attractive to this base of white voters he won because hillary clinton was less attractive to the traditional democratic base of urban minorities and more educated voters this is a profound fact because democratic voters were so extraordinarily repelled by trump that they were supposed to have the extra motivation to turn out running against trump any democratic candidate should have ridden a wave of antitrump sentiment among these voters it therefore took a strong distaste for hillary clinton among the democratic base to not only undo this wave but to lose many additional liberal votes the story of hillary clinton’s defeat then is not the trump movement erupting in the ballots nor the fable that some “reagan democrats” flipped again from obama to trump the story is altogether different and very simple the democratic base did not turn out to vote as it did for obama those suredemocrats who stayed home handed the election to trump take michigan for example a state that obama won in 2012 by 350000 votes clinton lost by roughly 10000 why she received 300000 votes less than obama did in 2012 detroit and wayne county should kick themselves because of the 595253 votes they gave obama in 2012 only 518000 voted for clinton in 2016 more than 75000 motown obama voters did not bother to vote for clinton they did not become trump voters – trump received only 10000 votes more than romney did in this county they simply stayed at home if even a fraction of these lethargic democrats had turned out to vote michigan would have stayed blue wisconsin tells the same numbers story even more dramatically trump got no new votes he received exactly the same number of votes in america’s dairyland as romney did in 2012 both received 1409000 votes but clinton again could not spark many obama voters to turn out for her she tallied 230000 votes less than obama did in 2012 this is how a 200000vote victory margin for obama in the badger state became a 30000vote defeat for clinton this pattern is national clinton’s black voter turnout dropped more than 11 percent compared to 2012 the support for clinton among active black voters was still exceedingly high 87 percent versus 93 percent for obama but the big difference was the turnout almost two million black votes cast for obama in 2012 did not turn out for clinton according to one plausible calculation if in north carolina blacks had turned out for clinton as they had for obama she would have won the state i saw a similar downtrend in my own eyes i voted in a predominantly african american precinct in the south side of chicago and i can testify that the lines for early voting at the polling place were much shorter than they were in 2012 i can only speculate how many bernie sanders supporters held out even after the democratic convention about a third of sanders followers were still not supporting clinton a month before the election 55 percent of them were continuing to view clinton negatively and a week before the elections sanders was still pleading with supporters in madison wisconsin to “go beyond personality” and show up for clinton could it be that their dispassion for their party’s candidate rode trump to victory it is of course true that in some areas like pennsylvania trump’s gains over romney were more impressive than clinton’s loss of obama voters so the story of an energized gop working class base is not a total fantasy but whatever trump successfully stirred among gop voters was not enough to win the election trump won despite being flawed in many ways because hillary clinton was deemed even more flawed by her own base the clinton camp is going to deny the charge that trump won because clinton failed to bring out the vote they would point to the large unprecedented 13 million margin of victory that clinton enjoyed in the popular vote the problem with this popular vote margin is that much of it comes from uncontested states like california and new york california alone gave clinton a 32 million popular vote advantage since the margin of victory does not count trump did not campaign in california and it is possible that many gop supporters did not bother to vote if the popular vote were to matter candidates would surely have paid more attention to these large states and the voting patterns could have shaped up differently trump would still have lost california but perhaps by a different margin it is remarkable and surprising that the elections were decided by democrats distaste for clinton and not trump’s ability to reach expand the republican vote think back to the weeks leading to the elections there was a shared sense that the republican party was losing and even disintegrating because it was unable to clamp down on a renegade candidate having allowed populism to prevail in the primaries the democratic party by contrast was thought to be on the verge of victory and even a sweep of the senate because it was cold calculated using its ironfisted internal machination to discard the populist candidate and to present the thenthought more “electable” clinton how wrong that perception turned out to be

Girls,https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/locals-were-troubled-by-roy-moores-interactions-with-teen-girls-at-the-gadsden-mall,wenchette,1453,144,roy moore the republican senate candidate and former chief justice of the alabama supreme court was born in gadsden a small city flanked by interstate 59 and the coosa river an hour northeast of birmingham gadsden is hilly woodsy bluecollar and religious “legal or not sin is sin” a sign in front of a church announced yesterday i saw it as i drove around crisscrossing george wallace drive i also saw trump posters confederate flags and dozens of signs for doug jones the democrat tied with moore in recent senaterace polls gadsden is the seat of etowah county which is a conservative place donald trump received three times as many votes in the county as hillary clinton did statewide he received twice as many but i didn’t in all my driving see a single yard sign for moore the hometown son even the parking lot of the one mall in town had more bumper stickers for luther strange four moore’s opponent in the republican primary than for moore himself one the gadsden mall opened in 1974 it has two department stores belk and sears one on each end between them on sunday night i walked past booksamillion cellular solutions a japanese steak house great american cookies blacklight minigolf knockerball gadsden an eyebrowstyling kiosk and a clothing store for young girls called justice a diverse assortment of families wandered around the place which felt trapped in time two young security guards made their rounds “it gets rough in here on saturday nights” one of them told me mentioning fighting stealing and guntoting “we still have an active ban list” the other said referencing a list of chronic rulebreakers not allowed on mall property “but it doesn’t go back that far” he meant back to the early eighties when roy moore was many people say a regular visitor to the mall on thursday the washington post reported that when moore was a thirtytwoyearold assistant district attorney in etowah county he brought leigh corfman who was fourteen years old at the time to his home and sexually molested her three additional women told the post that moore had pursued them when they were in their teens and he was in his early thirties on monday another woman beverly young nelson said that moore assaulted her when she was sixteen years old at a press conference she held up a highschool yearbook that she said moore signed before the alleged assault two of the women say that they first met moore at the gadsden mall and the post reports that several other women who used to work there remembered moore’s frequent presence—“usually alone” and “welldressed in slacks and a buttondown shirt” beverly young nelson who has accused roy moore of sexual assault holds up a highschool yearbook that she says moore signed when he was in his thirties photograph by eduardo munoz alvarez afp getty this past weekend i spoke or messaged with more than a dozen people—including a major political figure in the state—who told me that they had heard over the years that moore had been banned from the mall because he repeatedly badgered teenage girls some say that they heard this at the time others in the years since these people include five members of the local legal community two cops who worked in the town several people who hung out at the mall in the early eighties and a number of former mall employees a request for comment from the moore campaign was not answered several of them asked that i leave their names out of this piece the stories that they say they’ve heard for years have been swirling online in the days since the post published its report “sources tell me moore was actually banned from the gadsden mall and the ymca for his inappropriate behavior of soliciting sex from young girls” the independent alabama journalist glynn wilson wrote on his web site on sunday wilson declined to divulge his sources teresa jones a deputy district attorney for etowah county in the early eighties told cnn last week that “it was common knowledge that roy dated highschool girls” jones told me that she couldn’t confirm the alleged mall banning but said “it’s a rumor i’ve heard for years” greg legat who is now fiftynine and living in east gadsden was from 1981 to 1985 an employee at the record bar a store that was in the gadsden mall by the early eighties legat told me the mall was “the place to be there were no empty stores and lots of kids came around lots of teenagers you went there to see and be seen” legat met his wife jo anne there she worked at a restaurant called orange bowl legat remembers that parents dropped their kids off at the mall typically unchaperoned teens filled the place legat says that he saw moore there a few times even though his understanding then was that he had already been banned “it started around 1979 i think” legat said “i know the ban was still in place when i got there” legat recalled a gadsden police officer named j d thomas now retired who worked security at the mall “j d was a fixture there when i was working at the store” legat said “he really looked after the kids there he was a good guy j d told me ‘if you see roy let me know he’s banned from the mall’ ” legat recalled thomas telling him “if you see moore here tell me i’ll take care of him’ ” legat said that his boss eddie hill also told him to look for moore a phone call to hill’s number was not returned reached by phone on saturday thomas who lives in the nearby town of southside declined to discuss the existence of a ban on moore at the gadsden mall “i don’t have anything to say about that” he said a former manager of the mall who began working there in the late eighties confirmed the existence of a ban list but did not recall moore being on the list during the manager’s tenure there barnes boyle who is eightysix also managed the mall from 1981 to 1998 his wife brenda told me that moore was a longtime acquaintance of his—they went to the ymca together often—and that he planned to vote for him the recent allegations against moore the boyles thought are likely liberal propaganda and as brenda put it “a sign of the times” jason nelms an it worker who grew up in nearby southside and now lives in tennessee regularly visited the gadsden mall as a teenager in the early eighties “it was a joke from one of the managersassistant managers that they couldn’t keep an eye on their theater and an eye on the kids outside” he explained to me via facebook messenger “us kids would congregate outside on the sidewalk near the theater after the mall closed on friday and saturday nights anyway when asked why they had to keep an eye outside they said that some older guy had been trying to pick up younger girls they didn’t go beyond that but one of the concession workers whispered to us later that it was roy moore he was talking about” gadsden’s current lawenforcement community could not confirm the existence of a mall ban on moore but two officers i spoke to this weekend both of whom asked to remain unnamed told me that they have long heard stories about moore and the mall “the general knowledge at the time when i moved here was that this guy is a lawyer cruising the mall for highschool dates” one of the officers said the legal age of consent in alabama is sixteen so it would not be illegal there for a man in his early thirties to date a girl who was say a senior in high school but these officers along with the other people i spoke to said that moore’s presence at the mall was regarded as a problem “i was told by a girl who worked at the mall that he’d been run off from there from a number of stores maybe not legally banned but run off” one officer told me he also said “i heard from one girl who had to tell the manager of a store at the mall to get moore to leave her alone”

Nearly 15,000 Americans die each year from asbestos-related diseases",http://www.newsweek.com/pruitt-trump-asbestos-chemicals-trump-962703,therecordcorrected,1447,76,the environmental protection agency will not consider the health risks and impacts of asbestos already in the environment when evaluating the dangers associated with the chemical compound scott pruitt the agencys head quietly announced last week that means asbestos used in tiles piping and adhesives throughout homes and businesses in the united states will remain largely unchecked and unaccounted for nearly 15000 americans die each year from asbestosrelated diseases but president donald trump has called the substance 100 percent safe once applied related trump said he was the only one to fix infrastructure—so why is dominos pizza stepping in in his 1997 book the art of the comeback trump argued that the association of the chemical with health risks was part of a mobcreated conspiracy i believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob because it was often mobrelated companies that would do the asbestos removal great pressure was put on politicians and as usual the politicians relented he wrote the trump epas decision came in response to new amendments made to the toxic substances control act in 2016 the additions to the bill mandate that the epa perform safety reviews of certain chemicals require testing and public notice of safety info for said chemicals and allow the epa to ban certain uses of asbestos previously the epa did not have the authority to do so the epa announced last friday that it would evaluate and require approval for new uses of asbestos but would not evaluate the health risks of asbestos already in the environment the end result will be a seriously inadequate risk evaluation that fails to address major contributors to the heavy and growing toll of asbestos mortality and disease in the united states said linda reinstein president of the asbestos disease awareness organization in a statement reinstein whose husband developed mesothelioma and passed away in 2006 told newsweek that she met with nancy beck deputy assistant administrator of the epas office of chemical safety and pollution prevention on two occasions along with representatives from the aflcio and the international association of fire fighters the group explained the hazards of legacy asbestos and presented over 100 studies confirming that lowdose asbestos exposure caused disease but were shut down by beck she said beck was previously a senior director at the american chemistry council a lobbyist group that represents dow chemical dupont monsanto and exxonmobil chemical in august of 2016 the american chemistrycouncil sent a letter to the epa urging the agency to carefully consider its decision regarding asbestos evaluation as the chemical is essential to the chloralkali industry which creates chlorine and sodium hydroxide for industrial use they asked the epa to take this into consideration as it determines whether to select asbestos among the initial 10 chemicals for risk evaluation under the changes to the toxic substances control act chemical lobbyist agencies including american chemical council held at least four meetings with the epa last year regarding asbestos policy if you dont evaluate the dangerous legacy of asbestos you dont know how much contamination still exists in the united states reinstein told newsweek we know its in our homes schools workplace and environment but the average american cant identify and evaluate the risk we have taken risk evaluation off the table the bipartisan updates made to the toxic substances control act by congress were intended to give the epa the ability to ban the use of these substances some senators say the environmental agency attempted to ban the use in 1989 but a federal court ruled that it lacked the authority to do so in a bipartisan compromise congress moved to patch up the holes in our chemical review system when it updated the toxic substances control act but scott pruitt and the trump administration are presiding over an attack on not just the spirit but also the actual content of the reform law said senator edward j markey a member of the environment and public works committee in a statement thousands of people die from asbestosrelated cancers every year asbestos and other toxic substances will continue to contaminate our environment because trump administration policies are contaminating the epa theres a lack of basic information in the united states about the extent to which public and private structures are contaminated by the chemical a recent report found that the government has no record of how many schools contain asbestos materials epas refusal to address longstanding concerns around the use and disposal of asbestos is further proof that administrator pruitt will bend over backwards to help industry but wont lift a finger to protect public health said congressman frank pallone jr ranking member of the energy and commerce committee the epa did say that it would take unprecedented action on asbestos by requiring new manufacturers and importers of asbestos to receive epa approval before importing or processing the chemical reinstein however said that this is not a ban and that the largest users of asbestos will continue to use it fiftyfive countries including australia the united kingdom south africa israel and japan have completely banned asbestos use the white house referred newsweek to the epa and the epa did not respond to a request for comment

barresi during the campaign but according to criminal information filed against alexander and four people suspected of being coconspirators just days before the 2016 presidential election by the

This kind of bald corruption is chewing at the roots of the United States as a functioning nation.",http://theweek.com/articles/785508/there-must-reckoning,therecordcorrected,1409,123,president trump committed yet another grotesque violation of the constitution on his recent trip to scotland when he used nearly 70000 in public money to pay for rooms at a hotel in scotland he owns directly the scotsman reports this kind of bald corruption is chewing at the roots of the united states as a functioning nation if constitutional democracy is to survive here there must be a reckoning with this scandal — and that means prosecutions and prison sentences it is simply unquestionable that trumps behavior is a violation of constitutional stipulations about how the president is to be compensated heres what it says the president shall at stated times receive for his services a compensation which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the united states or any of them the constitution of the united states i have written before about how originalism is a ridiculous and impossible doctrine particularly when it comes to thorny issues of rights and due process but some things are just bleeding obvious like how the 13th amendment clearly abolishes chattel slavery this certainly was not some kind of simple travel reimbursement when the president travels on official business the government pays for his expenses according to ethics rules established to conform to the constitution and us law — for obvious reasons you cant just stay at or buy whatever you want on the government nickel but more importantly as a congressional research service report details when a trip is for political or unofficial purposes those involved must pay for their own food and lodging and other related expenses as well as reimburse the government for the equivalent of a commercial airline fare trump played two rounds of golf at his resort and the scotsman reported that trumps son eric — who is not even a government employee — was put up in the most expensive room in the place a twobedroom lighthouse suite that runs £7000 per night or about 9100 what the government was charged for exactly isnt yet available but eric trumps claim that the hotel was the cheapest option is utterly preposterous an emolument is just a payment of some kind trump very obviously used his presidential power to pay himself tens of thousands of dollars and give a family member a handsome goodie to boot whether one takes the clear view of the constitutional drafters or closely examines precedent or reads the text according to modern usage or interprets it in light of what is sensible and necessary for a modern state all possible schools of interpretation point in the same direction it is absolutely unacceptable for the head of state to use government power to directly enrich himself it is practically the dictionary definition of abuse of power indeed this is considerably worse than the sordid behavior of some gangsterriddled postcommunist eastern european state romania for instance recently decriminalized abuses of office where the financial damage is less than 48000 but as matt steinglass points out a former romanian deputy prime minister and current head of the largest party was recently convicted of corruption and sentenced to three and a half years in prison for merely using his authority to keep two party members employed at a public agency that is maybe 01 percent of what trump is doing here — and this is not remotely the first time hes done this kind of thing indeed its not even the first time hes spent public money on this individual hotel not to mention how nearly every single one of his top officials also has had both hands in the public till this is the kind of moral and political rot that topples nations whats more trumps moneygrubbing is also almost certainly a violation of written anticorruption statutes even given how the reactionary supreme court majority has cored out those laws with federalist society arglebargle it clearly runs afoul of antiembezzlement law and arguably also 18 us code § 201 which lays out penalties for any public official who directly or indirectly demands seeks receives accepts or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such official or person the supreme court legalized corruption in part by raising a nearimpossible standard of proof for demonstrating a quid pro quo but in this case the beneficiary to the corrupt act is trump himself not some other businessman looking for a handout the roots of the corruption crisis go deep as usual for trump one of the more outrageous of the many gross errors committed by barack obama was his cowardly refusal to prosecute any of the dozens of bush administration criminals most notably the entire top echelon of the bush defense establishment including the president and the vice president conspired to commit one of the worst crimes in existence — torture at least one of the victims was killed and no good intelligence was produced according to united states law and a dulyenacted treaty that is a crime punishable by any sentence up to and including death when he took office obama claimed he wanted to look forward as opposed to looking backwards — meaning de facto legal immunization of bushera war criminals when the senate intelligence committee mounted a fairly pitiful investigation of the torture program and the cia illegally spied on senate staffers and referred them for prosecution in what committee chair sen dianne feinstein dcalif called a potential attempt to intimidate this staff obama backed the cia to the hilt when the executive summary of the report came out obama flippantly admitted torture had been committed but then delivered a hectoring lecture that the perpetrators were patriots who had tough jobs and so we shouldnt get too sanctimonious about the whole beatingpeopletodeathfornoreason thing but that was only the start of how his administration enabled rampant criminality through inaction as jesse eisenger details in the chickenshit club under obama prosecution of major whitecollar crimes virtually ceased altogether wall street got a nearly free pass for an incomprehensible crime spree getting wristslap settlements for millions of illegal foreclosures done with forged documents rigging municipal bond markets money laundering for terrorists and drug cartels and literally thousands of other crimes in many cases as with the epic catastrophe of homeowners assistance the administration actively enabled the crimes now obama is not entirely responsible for this infestation of corruption its more that he inherited a government where the rule of law had been slowly collapsing for a long time going back at least to the richard nixon pardon and opted to let it continue to collapse into utter ruination i think the main reason he did that is classic american chauvinism — the idea that this is the best country in the world the land of opportunity america is great because in no other country on earth is my story even possible as obama said in his famous 2004 convention speech it was a crock then and its flagrantly preposterous now we see now what happens when this stupid narcissistic attitude is allowed to replace the rule of law — when people sing hosannas to americas greatness instead of actually trying to make it so hey presto you get a lot of criminals now one is president as are most of his important staff they must not be allowed to escape punishment

jeff sessions rala spoke twice last year with russia’s ambassador to the united states justice department officials said encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of president trump’s campaign and representatives of moscow during sessions’s confirmation hearing to become attorney general one of the meetings was a private conversation between sessions and russian ambassador sergey kislyak that took place in september in the senator’s office at the height of what us intelligence officials say was a russian cyber campaign to upend the us presidential race the previously undisclosed discussions could fuel new congressional calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate russia’s alleged role in the 2016 presidential election as attorney general sessions oversees the justice department and the fbi which have been leading investigations into russian meddling and any links to trump’s associates he has so far resisted calls to recuse himself when sessions spoke with kislyak in july and september the senator was a senior member of the influential armed services committee as well as one of trump’s top foreign policy advisers sessions played a prominent role supporting trump on the stump after formally joining the campaign in february 2016 what jeff sessions said about russia and when senate judiciary committee at his jan 10 judiciary committee confirmation hearing sessions was asked by sen al franken dminn what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the trump campaign communicated with the russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign “i’m not aware of any of those activities” he responded he added “i have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and i did not have communications with the russians” trump administration sought to enlist intelligence officials key lawmakers to counter russia stories officials said sessions did not consider the conversations relevant to the lawmakers’ questions and did not remember in detail what he discussed with kislyak “there was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer” said sarah isgur flores sessions’s spokeswoman victoria walkerthe washington post in january sen patrick j leahy dvt asked sessions for answers to written questions “several of the presidentelect’s nominees or senior advisers have russian ties have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the russian government about the 2016 election either before or after election day” leahy wrote sessions responded with one word “no” in a statement issued wednesday night sessions said he “never met with any russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign i have no idea what this allegation is about it is false” justice officials said sessions met with kislyak on sept 8 in his capacity as a member of the armed services panel rather than in his role as a trump campaign surrogate “he was asked during the hearing about communications between russia and the trump campaign — not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the armed services committee” flores said she added that sessions last year had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the armed services committee including the british korean japanese polish indian chinese canadian australian and german ambassadors in addition to kislyak in the case of the september meeting one department official who came to the defense of the attorney general said “there’s just not strong recollection of what was said” the russian ambassador did not respond to requests for comment about his contacts with sessions the washington post contacted all 26 members of the 2016 senate armed services committee to see whether any lawmakers besides sessions met with kislyak in 2016 of the 20 lawmakers who responded every senator including chairman john mccain rariz said they did not meet with the russian ambassador last year the other lawmakers on the panel did not respond as of wednesday evening “members of the committee have not been beating a path to kislyak’s door” a senior senate armed services committee staffer said citing tensions in relations with moscow besides sessions the staffer added “there haven’t been a ton of members who are looking to meet with kislyak for their committee duties” last month the post reported that trump national security adviser michael flynn had discussed us sanctions with kislyak during the month before trump took office contrary to public assertions by mike pence the vice presidentelect and other top trump officials flynn was forced to resign the following week national security adviser flynn discussed sanctions with russian ambassador despite denials officials say when asked to comment on sessions’s contacts with kislyak franken said in a statement to the post on wednesday “if it’s true that attorney general sessions met with the russian ambassador in the midst of the campaign then i am very troubled that his response to my questioning during his confirmation hearing was at best misleading” franken added “it is now clearer than ever that the attorney general cannot in good faith oversee an investigation at the department of justice and the fbi of the trumprussia connection and he must recuse himself immediately” several democratic members of the house on wednesday night called on sessions to resign from his post democrats call for sessions’s resignation and special prosecutor “after lying under oath to congress about his own communications with the russians the attorney general must resign” house minority leader nancy pelosi dcalif said in a statement adding that “sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country” sen ron wyden dore a senior member of the senate intelligence committee said on twitter late wednesday that “we need a special counsel to investigate trump associates’ ties to russia” sen lindsey o graham rsc said at a cnn town hall wednesday night that if the substance of sessions’s conversations with the russian ambassador proved to be improper or suspect he too would join the call for sessions to recuse himself from the investigation “if there is something there and it goes up the chain of investigation it is clear to me that jeff sessions who is my dear friend cannot make that decision about trump” graham said — although he stressed that sessions’s contacts with the russian ambassador could have been “innocent” “but if there’s something there that the fbi thinks is criminal in nature then for sure you need a special prosecutor if that day ever comes i’ll be the first one to say it needs to be somebody other than jeff” current and former us officials say they see kislyak as a diplomat not an intelligence operative but they were not sure to what extent if any kislyak was aware of or involved in the covert russian election campaign steven hall former head of russia operations at the cia said that russia would have been keenly interested in cultivating a relationship with sessions because of his role on key congressional committees and as an early adviser to trump sessions’s membership on the armed services committee would have made him a priority for the russian ambassador “the fact that he had already placed himself at least ideologically behind trump would have been an added bonus for kislyak” hall said michael mcfaul a stanford university professor who until 2014 served as us ambassador to russia said he was not surprised that kislyak would seek a meeting with sessions “the weird part is to conceal it” he said “that was at the height of all the discussions of what russia was doing during the election” two months before the september meeting sessions attended a heritage foundation event in july on the sidelines of the republican national convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors when the event was over a small group of ambassadors approached sessions as he was leaving the podium and kislyak was among them the justice department official said fbi once planned to pay former british spy who authored controversial trump dossier sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors including kislyak the official said in the informal exchanges the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring said the official citing a former sessions staffer who was at the event democratic lawmakers including senior members of the senate judiciary committee have demanded in recent weeks that sessions recuse himself from the government’s inquiry into possible ties between trump associates and russia last week rep darrell issa rcalif a senior member of the house judiciary committee became one of the few republican representatives to state publicly the need for an independent investigation sessions’s public

trump’s plan to build better relations with russian president vladimir putin “donald trump is right we need to figure out a way to end this cycle of hostility that’s putting this country at risk costing us billions of dollars in defense and creating hostilities” sessions told cnn asked whether he viewed putin as a good or bad leader sessions told cnn “we have a lot of bad leaders around the world that operate in ways we would never tolerate in the united states but the question is can we have a more peaceful effective relationship with russia utilizing interests that are similar in a realistic way to make this world a safer place and get off this dangerous hostility with russia i think it’s possible” julie tate robert costa and karoun demirjian contributed to this report read more

So she did.,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/23/politics/donald-trump-nancy-pelosi/index.html,therecordcorrected,1388,73,that much now seems definite following an exchange of hugely passiveaggressive letters between trump and house speaker nancy pelosi on wednesday a battle of words that ended with pelosi informing trump that she would not be introducing a concurrent resolution allowing him to address a bicameral session of congress on january 29 what it means is that we are now through the looking glass on the 33rd day of the longest government shutdown in american history the speaker of the house has disinvited the president of the united states from delivering his annual update to congress a tradition that has been around since george washington delivered the first state of the union address at federal hall in new york city on january 8 1790 there are three certain conclusions as a result of pelosis response to trumps letter earlier wednesday in which he insisted he was planning to show up to give his speech in the house next tuesday despite her previous letter asking him to postpone his speech or deliver it in writing a la thomas jefferson there are a slew of questions that follow from these certainties will this cancellation further set back any attempt at compromise on reopening the government will trump give some sort of kind of sort of state of the union speech from some other location if so where will it be knowing trump and watching what he and his surrogates have said over the last few days it seems like a virtual certainty that trump will speak somewhere and call it a state of the union address i outlined four potential alternate locations here whether he does that from the halls of congress or whether he does that in another location the president will talk to the american people on january 29 as he does nearly every single day white house press secretary sarah sanders said in an interview on fox friends on wednesday morning seen through that lens trumps letter to pelosi on wednesday afternoon was a purely political ploy as this whole thing has been on both sides designed to put the onus on the speaker to respond and more accurately to respond that trump couldnt speak from the house floor shortly after pelosis letter denying trump that privilege was reported by cnns manu raju trump was asked about it and said this im not surprised its really a shame whats happening with the democrats theyve become radicalized they dont want to see crime stop which we can very easily do on the southern border and it really is a shame whats happening with the democrats in truth none of this should be surprising trump promised a totally and completely unorthodox presidency and literally every day of his twoplus years in the white house he has delivered on that pledge whats changed over these past two years is democratic tactics in dealing with trump the party spent much of the first months of trumps presidency still shellshocked that he had won and concerned that they had grossly misunderstood the electorate but as trumps conduct became more and more outrageous and to me his mishandling of the aftermath of the white supremacist violence in charlottesville virginia was the tipping point democrats realized that treating trump like an even seminormal president was not a feasible strategy because democrats were in the minority in the house and senate through the first two years of trumps term they had a relatively limited ability to follow through on that fundamental shift in their thinking about trump but the 2018 election changed all of that suddenly democrats had the majority in the house due in no small part to their pledge to provide a check on trump what we have seen over the past week pelosi sent her original letter rescinding the january 29 state of the union invite on january 16 is simply one of a series of ways in which democrats are using their power in the house to conduct asymmetric political warfare against trump the idea of banning the president of the united states from the chance to deliver his state of the union from the house floor was unimaginable under past presidents yes democrats loathed many of george w bushs policies but this sort of noyoumaynotevencometothehouse strategy was never considered and yes rep joe wilson rsc shouted you lie at president barack obama during a speech to congress but obama was given the right to speak this whole thing is unprecedented and purposely so pelosi and her democratic colleagues have made the calculation that the only way you deal with a president like trump and unlike every president who has held the office before him is to go beyond where you would have thought you would be willing to go to press to the political extremes and beyond because you are dealing with a political opponent who has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to not just push the envelope but to act as though he is entirely unaware any sort of envelope exists let me repeat myself none of this is even marginally normal thats the way trump likes it and the way that democrats have accepted it must be if they want to effectively combat him and the effects of the policies he wants to put into place the loser in all of this political extremism is of course the 800000 federal workers who are either furloughed or working without pay its impossible to think wednesdays ugliness does anything but make a compromise to reopen the government an even more remote possibility and to be honest there wasnt much of a chance of it even before today that means days and maybe weeks more of working without pay or not working at all and thats the real tragedy of all of this
a3bwfu,2018-12-05 14:36:08,Democrats,GOP senators come out and say it: The Trump administration is covering up Khashoggi’s killing,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/04/gop-senators-come-out-say-it-trump-administration-is-covering-up-khashoggis-killing/,progress18,1387,58,this is completely contrary to the narrative that has been put forward by president trump and his secretary of state mike pompeo trump has said it’s unknowable whether the crown prince was actually behind it — despite the cia concluding this with “high confidence” — while pompeo said last week that there was no “direct reporting” implicating him ad ad graham said tuesday that you’d have to be “willfully blind” to not know mohammed was responsible — a clear rebuke of trump’s argument that this whole thing resides in some kind of gray area graham was also asked about pompeo’s comments and defense secretary jim mattis’s comments that there was no “smoking gun” the senator said there was indeed a “smoking saw” — a reference to the reported bonesaw that was brought to dismember khashoggi — and that pompeo was being a “good soldier” by toeing the administration’s line so that’s basically saying pompeo aided trump’s “willful” effort to obscure the truth “if they were in a democratic administration” graham said of pompeo and mattis “i would be all over them for being in the pocket of saudi arabia” ad corker was about as fullthroated saying “if the crown prince went in front of a jury he would be convicted in 30 minutes” — another clear rebuke to trump’s statement and pompeo’s and mattis’s suggestions that this is some kind of unknown ad corker also suggested that the briefing last week which featured pompeo and mattis but not haspel was entirely misleading when asked whether there was a difference in the message about mohammed’s culpability corker compared it to the “difference between darkness and sunshine” to be clear these senators aren’t just accusing the administration of missing the point on khashoggi they’re saying they feel misled and that the administration has obscured the truth graham saying he’d question pompeo’s and mattis’s motives if this were a democratic administration is a particularly striking statement — and one from someone who is a frequent trump ally these days corker has been more of a trump critic but his suggestion the he feels last week’s briefing wasn’t on the upandup is also remarkable from a republican

Resignation",https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/in-scathing-letter-more-than-80-percent-of-active-faculty-at-bill-barrs-law-school-call-for-his-censure-and-resignation/,paone22,1377,43,professors and deans at george washington university law school renounced one of their most prominent alumni on tuesday releasing a statement vilifying attorney general william barr’s conduct since taking up residence in the 45th president’s cabinet the undersigned faculty members requested that barr be investigated and censured but ultimately called for his resignation the 6page open letter signed by more than 80percent of the school’s active faculty members comes just days after barr – who graduated from gw law in 1977 – was lambasted over the bungled ouster of former us attorney for the southern district of new york sdny geoffrey berman barr had initially released a misleading statement claiming berman had “stepped down” which berman quickly denied barr then released a second statement saying president donald trump had fired berman hours later trump told reporters that he was “not involved” in the us attorney’s firing according to the legal educators barr “failed to fulfill his oath of office” by acting in a manner that had “undermined the rule of law damaged public confidence that the law applies equally and fairly to all persons and demonstrated contempt for basic constitutional rights” “attorney general barr places us in a unique position and imposes a unique duty on us to candidly confront his abuse of the office of the attorney general and his betrayal of professional norms and the constitution” the letter continued the group cited a list of barr’s most controversial acts—from his handling of the mueller report to his role in the federal government’s use of force to disperse peaceful protesters outside the white house at the beginning on june 2020 “william barr’s actions as attorney general since 2019 have undermined the rule of law breached constitutional norms and damaged the integrity and traditional independence of his office and of the department of justice” the group wrote “he obfuscated and misled the american public about the results of the mueller investigation he wrongfully interfered in the daytoday activities of career prosecutors and continues to do so bending the criminal justice system to benefit the president’s friends and target those perceived to be his enemies he participated in the forcible removal from public space of peaceful protesters exercising their first amendment rights to speech and assembly in order to protest racial injustice his actions have posed and continue to create a clear and present danger to the evenhanded administration of justice to civil liberties and to the constitutional order” the group also expressed solidarity with the more than 1000 former doj officials in calling for barr to resign from office and made clear that their statement was not politically motivated as the signees included members of both political parties and independents the statement was issued on the eve of the house judiciary committee’s scheduled whistleblower hearing during which current doj federal prosecutors are expected to testify about “improper politicization” of the doj under barr’s leadership george washington university law professor jonathan turley who did not sign the letter disagreed with the substance of his colleagues’ statement while praising their decision to sign the letter in their individual capacities “i commend my colleagues for their decision not to make such a statement as an institution even though they clearly had sufficient votes to do so their decision to state their views as individuals was an important demonstration of the continued support for collegiality and pluralism on our faculty” turley said in an email to lawcrime “however the letter makes a number of legal statements that i believe are contested unestablished or mistaken indeed this letter is being issued as investigations into lafayette park and both the flynn and stone case are producing new and material information i believe as law professors we should wait for such facts to be established before reaching such conclusions as ‘the attorney general believed that fulfilling the president’s personal wishes was more important than ensuring evenhanded justice for all federal criminal defendants’” on flynn turley pointed out that the “day after this letter was issued including its discussion of the district court’s handling of flynn case the court of appeals ordered its dismissal” turley noted that he has previously denounced eric holder over the “fast and furious” controversy and called for the resignation of former ag janet reno following waco he said that educators expressing their opinions in an individual capacity “without rancor or retaliation” benefits scholarly discourse “i have encouraged friends to read this letter because it is a cogent and powerful criticism of the decisions made by the attorney general there are goodfaith reasons to criticize this administration and attorney general barr indeed i have criticized both nevertheless there are many students alumni and faculty who disagree with the legal and policy statements contained in this letter” turley said “hopefully our school will remain a place where such diverse opinions can be shared and debated without rancor or retaliation the decision to use a letter of individual faculty members rather than a resolution of the school speaks to our continued commitment to such civil and scholarly discourse” read the full statement below 623 gw law faculty stmt on barr by lawcrime on scribd image via pbs screengrab have a tip we should know email protected

when they were the majority party — eschewing oversight of president donald trump and his administration and instead holding hearings into such topics as social media and campus censorship of trump supporters now that democrats are in the majority and holding hearings that describe the potential legal jeopardy facing the president house republicans are suddenly very upset about wasting time the gop members of the house committee on oversight and reform spent much of wednesday’s hearing with former trump attorney and fixer michael cohen who also served as the republican national committee deputy finance chair making it clear that they did not want to be there “this isn’t the reason the people of west virginia sent me to congress” complained republican rep carol miller rwv who ran her campaign on a pledge to support president trump miller said that she was “appalled” that the committee was listening to sworn testimony about alleged felonies committed by a sitting president when it “could be focused on actual issues that are facing america like border security neonatal abstinence syndrome or improving our nation’s crumbling infrastructure” she said the committee should instead be holding hearings on child separation — a policy implemented by trump’s own administration even the republicans’ oversight committee twitter account repeated the claim the cohenhearing was a sad display of congressional resources rod rosenstein should have testified today not michaelcohen pictwittercomub69nzwih4 — oversight committee republicans gopoversight february 27 2019 rep jim jordan roh argued that the committee should not be hearing from an admitted liar and instead should be interviewing deputy attorney general rod rosenstein about whether senior members of the department of justice had suggested that trump was unfit to continue serving as president jordan is under scrutiny because he was named in a classaction lawsuit suit by former ohio state wrestlers who say he knew about sexual abuse by a doctor on the team while jordan was a coach there and did not take action advertisement rep greg steube rfl attacked the hearing for having “zero probative value and zero credibility” and argued that they should instead spend their “limited time focusing on improving the lives of americans creating jobs or streamlining the functioning of our federal government” rep chip roy rtx said the american people want them to be securing the border balancing the budget and restoring “health care freedom” and thus “have a hell of a lot more important things to do than watch this” the committee’s republican members almost all repeated versions of this same argument the whole hearing was nothing more than a waste of time but until the beginning of january the republicans held a majority in the house and therefore controlled the agenda for committee hearings they spent a lot of time on political theater over the previous few years benghazi during the obama administration rep jordan served on the benghazi select committee a republicanlead effort that cost about 7 million dollars and held 33 hearings over more than two years into a topic that had already been investigated by seven other congressional committees the investigations followed a pair of deadly september 2012 attacks on us facilities in libya advertisement the select committee found no wrongdoing on the part of hillary clinton but in an unguarded moment house gop leader rep kevin mccarthy rca admitted that lengthy probes had had the desired effect — hurting her popularity “everybody thought hillary clinton was unbeatable right but we put together a benghazi special committee a select committee what are her numbers today her numbers are dropping why because she’s untrustable but no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought” he told fox news’ sean hannity in late 2015 investigating censorship against conservatives two gopled house oversight subcommittees held a hearing in july 2017 “challenges to freedom of speech on college campuses” that featured panelists like conservative provocateur ben shapiro and actor adam carolla shapiro who introduced himself as “editorinchief of the daily wire and host of the ben shapiro show podcast” claimed that cancelling speeches on college campuses “turns students into snowflakes craven and pathetic looking for an excuse to be offended so they can earn points in the intersectional olympics” carolla used his time to complain about a college cancelling an event with conservative commentator dennis prager and he cracked jokes about students who “grew up dipped in purell playing soccer games where they never kept score and watching wow wow wubbzy and we’re asking them to be mature” advertisement the threehour hearing concluded with rep jim jordan roh praising carolla and prager for producing a movie about “safe spaces” rep steve king ria opened a april 2017 house judiciary subcommittee hearing — “first amendment protections on public college and university campuses” — by complaining that geert wilders and charles murray faced consequences for engaging in hate speech the 90minute hearing featured a panelist from the first liberty institute which the southern poverty law center calls an “antilgbt and antichoice group” during the september hearing “the state of intellectual freedom in america” conspiracy theorists like the gateway pundit’s jim hoft and the boston herald’s adriana cohen were invited to address the house judiciary committee about baseless claims regarding conservatives being censored by social media giants though facebook’s decision to drastically scale back on news promotion following fallout from the 2016 election has impacted all publishers hoft claimed during the twohour hearing that “if facebook were seeking to hold a book burning they wouldn’t have been half as successful as they were in eliminating contrary points of view from being accessed by the american people” rep king who recently lost all of his committee assignments after decades of racist remarks offered a written statement that featured fox news contributor dan bongino claiming that twitter is “messing with me too it’s a cesspool” the threehour house judiciary hearing “facebook google and twitter examining the content filtering practices of social media giants” features executives from facebook twitter and youtube republicans read off a litany of baseless conspiracy theories about conservatives being censored on social media including rep lamar smith’s rtx baseless claim that google was censoring “jesus” from its search results king demanded answers about the gateway pundit’s reduced facebook traffic the gop members of the committee warned they would consider rewriting the laws that impact the social media giants fox news contributors lynnette hardaway and rochelle richardson — better known as diamond and silk — were the featured panelists during a house judiciary hearing in april titled “filtering practices of social media platforms” it was three hours long protrump personalities claimed they had been labeled as “unsafe to the community” by facebook and “demonetized” by youtube even though both companies refuted those claims diamond and silk also used their opening statement to discuss whether facebook founder mark zuckerberg was trying to “interfere in the 2018 elections” by limiting their reach rep louie gohmert rtx also said he would favor legislation to hold companies “liable” for nonexistent conservative censorship investigating violations of religious liberty against conservative christians less than a month after trump’s muslim ban was enacted rep king presided over a february 2017 house judiciary hearing “the state of religious liberty in america” about supposed threats to religious freedom in america that mostly focused on conservative christians after opening statements king and a panelist from the alliance defending freedom — which the southern poverty law center labels a hate group — discussed how “foundations of western civilization” are “being eroded in colleges and universities across our country” king also lamented that bakers are “forced to violate their conscience” when they are prevented from discriminating against the lgbtq community investigating hillary clinton and whether the 2016 election was rigged in her favor republicans called a joint hearing of house oversight and judiciary “oversight of the fbi and doj actions in advance of the 2016 election” to amplify baseless “deep state” claims about the russia investigation and former secretary of state hillary clinton last june in response to a longanticipated report from department of justice inspector general michael horowitz that didn’t find “any evidence of political bias or improper consideration actually impacting the investigation under review” the sevenhour hearing featured numerous references to conservative conspiracy theories regarding former fbi employees james comey peter strzok and lisa page trey gowdy rsc who was chairman of house judiciary opened the hearing by claiming comey “softened and watered down his press release announcing no charges against secretary clinton” two years earlier investigating the 2011 fast and furious sting with a june 2017 hearing called “fast and furious six years later” the gopled house oversight committee looked at a botched 2011 atf gunwalking sting that occurred during president barack obama’s presidency the threehour event occurred less than a month after trump fired comey and sen chuck grassley ria used his time to claim there was a “highlypoliticized climate at the obama administration’s main justice focused more on spin and cover up than on transparency and factfinding”
6ugzhc,2017-08-18 13:34:54,Democrats,"Weeping Nazi started off as a “men’s rights activist,” which is no huge surprise - Christopher Cantwell's trajectory from ""men's rights"" to white supremacy is sadly typical of the alt-right",http://www.salon.com/2017/08/18/weeping-nazi-started-off-as-a-mens-rights-activist-which-is-no-huge-surprise/,anutensil,1333,817,the white supremacist rally that turned violent — and then deadly — on saturday was immediately documented by vice news tonight and its correspondent elle reeve in a video documentary released on monday it wasnt just the turnaround speed that was impressive but the level of access the vice team got largely due to the choice to embed with christopher cantwell a selfappointed white supremacist leader whose big mouth and massive gun collection left an impression on the documentarys viewers watching the documentary its clear enough how vice got cantwell to agree to be so closely followed and repeatedly interviewed the guy craves the camera repeatedly playing up his ugly views to reeve clearly knowing that hes giving good soundbites that will make it into the documentary its no surprise then that cantwell followed up the rally by posting a dramatic video to social media where he manages to cry for four minutes about his fear of arrest all without shedding a tear the video went viral mostly because people want to see nazis cry and cantwell scored even more attention for himself advertisement it also didnt take long for internet sleuths to figure out that the 36yearold who now hosts a white supremacist talk show has quite a history of making a spectacle of himself and has rebranded as different flavors of jackass several times over the course of his illustrious career cantwell ran for congress in 2010 as a libertarian he and two friends started the free keane squad which made it to the colbert report in 2014 because their main form of activism appeared to be chasing meter maids around and harassing them for giving people parking tickets cantwell also identified as a mens rights activist and wrote for the site a voice for men one of the hubs of organized misogyny on the internet he expressed his views that the state supposedly gives women the power to have men arrested for anything without any evidence at all and how women in their roles of traditionally carrying the role of raising children and supporting the men did not evolve to have high iqs like men do allegedly its yet another example of how the world of online antifeminism has become a gateway to white supremacy while there hasnt been any rigid academic analysis of this phenomenon sites like we hunted the mammoth which started as a way to monitor the various and overlapping worlds of online misogyny have tracked that when men get together to gripe about their resentment of womens growing independence they often start drifting toward talking about white genocide and other white supremacist ideas advertisement the world of online misogynists is a complex maze some of the communities are geared towards older divorced men some are pickup artist sites geared towards younger men who think they arent getting the female attention they believe theyre due some identify as men going their own way which is to say giving up on women altogether but what brings them together is anger over the fact that feminism has liberated women to date whomever they wish and leave marriages that arent working this makes it much harder in the mens rights misogynist view for men to acquire or keep the submissive female partners they feel entitled to why hating women would lead so many men to hating nonwhite people is difficult to parse in logical terms but racism and sexism arent rational ideologies and really arent bound by the basic rules of logic at the root of both lies a thwarted sense of entitlement and a sense that women and people of color are somehow stealing what is the white mans due that was felt most keenly in charlottesville last friday night when the torchwielding mob chanted you will not replace us cantwell himself mentioned one of the most common narratives that white supremacists and mens rights activists use to link the two ideologies together by claiming that their women are being stolen from them by jews and men of color in one of his many interviews with reeve cantwell sneers at donald trump for giving his daughter to a jew and says “i don’t think you can feel about race the way i do and watch that kushner bastard walk around with that beautiful girl advertisement its hard to know where to start with this statement which is as delusional as it is offensive what struck me most watching the interview is how delighted cantwell is with himself hes tickled at how shocking his antisemitic views are and pleased with the chance to tell an actual woman that he views women as objects for men to trade rather than autonomous human beings that attentionseeking misogynistic impulse is evident in the colbert report video as well its quite clear that the elaborate political arguments against parking meters are just a fig leaf for the real goal of the free keane squad which lies in the thrill of videotaping themselves harassing people especially women the levels of overcompensation for insecurity are almost too painful to look at in the colbert report segment cantwell even says i find that when i carry a gun people are very unlikely to hit me that same pathetic impulse to use lethal firearms as a shield against profound insecurity is also evident in the vice documentary where cantwell makes a big show of spreading out and unloading his weapons in front of reeve advertisement taken altogether its no surprise that one of the favorite insults of the white supremacistmra crowd is the word cuck most outlets gently mention that its a reference to the antiquated english word cuckold but the grim reality is that most white supremacists almost certainly got the term not from elizabethan literature but from modern day cuckold porn much of which plays with racial stereotypes about white women cheating on their white husbands with black men that this would be popular enough among white supremacists to infiltrate their slang while continuing to confuse the rest of us speaks volumes about the insular obsessive culture of what we now call the altright the world of mens rights and pickup artists is easy enough to ignore since its just a bunch of bitter losers eager to blame their personal failures on women who ignore them unfortunately as this past weekend has shown those bitter losers can become powerful especially if theyre organized and wellarmed and have managed to talk each other into acts of violence the trick now is to understand the real threat they pose without empowering them further or giving them more of the attention they so desperately crave

anfvhk,2019-02-05 18:38:29,Democrats,"Texas Republicans Are Lying About Voter Fraud to Justify a Massive, Racist Voter Purge.",https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/texas-republicans-racist-illegal-voters-purge.html,Ghdust2,1295,83,on jan 25 texas attorney general ken paxton tweeted a “voter fraud alert” that quickly rocketed around the internet texas secretary of state david whitley paxton asserted had discovered that approximately “95000 individuals identified” as noncitizens are registered to vote in the state “58000 of whom have voted” in texas elections whitley promptly urged counties to begin purging these 95000 people from their voter rolls demanding proof of citizenship within 30 days or canceling their registrations donald trump joined the action tweeting on jan 27 that whitley’s numbers “are just the tip of iceberg” voter fraud trump wrote “is rampant must be stopped strong voter id” within days of paxton’s alarming tweet whitley had substantially backtracked the secretary of state quietly informed county officials that a “significant number” of people on the list are actually citizens texas director of elections keith ingram acknowledged that these were “weak matches” a “starting point” rather than a definitive list in harris county alone about 18000 names were removed from the initial list of alleged noncitizens some county officials however had already begun to notify residents on that first list that they had 30 days to prove their citizenship or lose their ability to vote the situation in texas is a mess but it is a dangerous mess paxton a notorious foe of voting rights is creating chaos and confusion in order to justify a radical purge of texas’ voter rolls as three new lawsuits filed by an array of civil rights groups argue this purge isn’t just slapdash and sloppy—it’s discriminatory and illegal paxton and his allies are taking a page from kris kobach’s playbook of shock and awe toss out a wildly inflated claim of noncitizen voting then use the ensuing panic to justify mass disenfranchisement it is a dirty and duplicitous tactic and thanks to america’s increasingly conservative judiciary it might actually succeed texas’ voter fraud pandemonium is actually a combination of kobach’s two favorite moves creating dubious lists of allegedly fraudulent voters to disenfranchise and forcing people to prove citizenship in order to cast a ballot whitley’s purge list was created using a profoundly flawed method his office identified individuals who presented documents indicating that they were not citizens when obtaining or renewing driver’s licenses using department of public safety records dating back to 1996 it then crossreferenced this list with voter rolls to come up with the numbers paxton quoted—95000 aliens registered to vote 58000 of whom have cast a ballot get the angle in your inbox every weekday slate’s

offers by signing up you agree to our privacy policy and terms sign up thanks for signing up you can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time this methodology has a massive flaw more than 50000 texas residents are naturalized each year and when they become citizens they are not obligated to inform the department of public safety it is therefore extremely likely that many if not all of the individuals whom whitley flagged have become us citizens and are perfectly lawful texas voters driver’s licenses issued to noncitizens are valid for six years and over the last six years nearly 350000 texas adults have been naturalized if even onethird of those adults registered to vote they could easily account for the total number of “noncitizen” voter registrants on whitley’s list whitley’s purge list was created using a profoundly flawed method despite this obvious defect whitley has pushed ahead with the purge even after warning election officials that the list might be faulty he has not retracted it leaving counties to implement a purge known to target naturalized citizens even worse he has pressed ahead with a plan to create a new list of alleged noncitizen voters every month directing voter registrars to “take action” upon receiving each new batch of names election officials will send a single notice to these voters informing them that they are set to be removed from the rolls if they do not provide a birth certificate passport or certificate of naturalization proving us citizenship within 30 days they will be purged properly understood then paxton and whitley are not purging noncitizen voters they are purging naturalized voters who have a fundamental right to participate in elections like any other citizen why one possibility noted in a lawsuit filed by the mexican american legal defense and education fund on saturday is that 517 percent of naturalized us citizens in texas are latino while 288 percent are asian in the 2018 midterm election texas latinos more than doubled their turnout compared to the 2014 midterms casting 191 percent of all votes maldef argues that the purge “will disproportionately and negatively affect latinos” since “the latino population in texas has a higher ratio of naturalized citizens to nativeborn citizens” the maldef lawsuit alleges that texas’ actions violate the equal protection clause which generally

of united latin american citizens which filed a similar lawsuit also allege that paxton and whitley are engaging in illegal voter intimidation in violation of the vra a third lawsuit brought by the american civil liberties union dēmos the lawyers’ committee for civil rights under law and the texas civil rights project raises vra and equal protection claims as well it argues that texas is placing an undue burden on naturalized citizens’ constitutional right to vote and infringing on their due process rights and it asserts that texas is engaging in intentional racial discrimination in violation of the 14th and 15th amendments all three lawsuits were brought on behalf of texas voters targeted by whitley’s list these are powerful arguments backed by substantial evidence of official malfeasance but the supreme court bolstered by trump’s judicial nominees have mastered the art of waving away proof of racism to uphold voter suppression laws plus the court already gutted the voting rights act whose nowdefunct preclearance provision could’ve halted a voter purge like this one just last june the supreme court’s conservative majority ignored the obvious discrimination behind texas’ racial gerrymander writing that courts must “presume” the “good faith” of legislatures paxton and whitley’s attack on minority voters is about as blatant as racist disenfranchisement can get in 2019 but there’s a depressingly good chance that our trumppacked courts will pretend to see no evil

political abomination as i have written before rather than protecting the influence of small states it grants overwhelming power to a handful of states that randomly happen to have a close partisan balance which are mostly fairly large worse it allows popular vote losers to win — which has happened twice in the last 20 years indeed theoretically a candidate could lose the popular vote four to one and still win the electoral votemoreover since 2012 the divergence between the electoral college and the popular vote has been steadily growing as ill show below while joe biden won a clear victory in the popular vote he just barely squeaked through in the electoral college this idiotic anachronism must be destroyedlets take a look at this over the last two decades one way to examine this question is to look at the most efficient way that losing candidates could have won the electoral college in other words if we add up the state totals for previous elections going back to 2000 how might the losers have won by flipping the least number of votesusing data from us elections atlas and 2020 data from the the new york times including a rough extrapolation assuming biden wins 80 percent of the mailin votes that havent been counted yet in new york state i calculated how the popular vote losers could have won the electoral college — or lost in the case of george w bush in 2000 and donald trump in 2016in 2000 of course bush officially won florida by 537 votes and therefore the presidency with 271 electoral votes while al gore won the popular vote by about 550000 in reality gore probably would have won a fair recount in florida if it hadnt been stopped by a conservative supreme court on nakedly partisan grounds but im going to ignore that for the time being since it doesnt matter for this particular argument that means a flip of just 269 votes in one state from one candidate to the other would have changed the result in 2004 bush won reelection with a margin of about three million votes and 286 electoral votes john kerry famously could have won if he had just flipped ohio where the margin was just 118601 votes however it would have been slightly more efficient in vote terms to flip new mexico iowa nevada and alaska with a cumulative margin of 117411 that means a flip of just 58706 votes would have given kerry the presidencyin 2008 barack obama steamrolled john mccain with a popular vote margin of over 95 million and 365 electoral votes but it would have taken relatively few vote changes to overturn even that landslide result obama won florida colorado iowa rhode island maine new mexico nevada vermont delaware new hampshire indiana and north carolina by a cumulative margin of just 1436 million votes — therefore flipping just 718138 would have given mccain an additional 97 electoral votes and victory similarly in 2012 mitt romney could have won by taking the nine closest states in terms of total votes requiring only 384188 flips then in 2016 trump of course squeaked out an electoral college victory with tiny margins in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania — just 38868 flips would have given clinton the winthat finally brings me to 2020 biden won the popular vote easily with a margin maybe in the neighborhood of 69 million or so depending on what happens in new york but it would have taken just 33139 flips in arizona georgia and wisconsin to deliver a trump second termbringing this all together if we plot these minimum vote flips to change the electoral college result as a percentage of the popular vote margin we can get a sense of how badly it diverges from the principle of one person one votecourtesy us elections atlaswhat this shows is that the electoral college is routinely on the edge of handing the popular vote loser the presidency even when it doesnt happen — and it seems to be getting worse in 2008 and 2012 it would have taken a flip of 75 percent and 11 percent of the popular vote margin still not great but in 2016 flipping just 13 percent of the margin would change the result the 2020 election meanwhile is the worst result since 2000 — though biden did win a flip of a mere 048 percent of the popular vote margin or something like 002 percent of the total vote would have let trump win moreover while the 2008 flipping scenario outlined above relies on implausible large percentage swings in small states like vermont bidens victory depended on razorthin margins in three swing statesall this speaks for itself but before republicans get too smug about cooking up justifications for the electoral college because it happens to help them at the moment consider that in 2004 flipping just 19 percent of the popular vote margin would have delivered the presidency to the democrat even though bush got three million more votes because the electoral colleges rules are so goofy and arbitrary it is very easy to imagine demographic trends handing the dems a nearautomatic victory every time — if texas went solidly blue for instance it would be better and fairer for everyone if the presidency simply went to the candidate that got the most votesmore stories

nominee joe biden for president a stunning rebuke of president donald trump by the widow of the gops 2008 nominee in an interview on nbcs today show wednesday mccain said shes been deeply concerned with whats been occurring across the country joe biden represents to me the kinds of values and integrity and courage that we want in a president and someone who i think would have my back as a citizen and someone who lives in a neighborhood and has a family and all the other things that people do she said i want to feel like my president cares about me and cares about this country and joe biden does i do believe that hell make a wonderful president with regards to not only the military but in every other aspect and most importantly and the thing that touches me a great deal is that joe has great empathy for people in this country people that are struggling people that are suffering mccain added after the interview on nbc trump bashed the mccains on twitter i hardly know cindy mccain other than having put her on a committee at her husband’s request joe biden was john mccain’s lapdog so many bad decisions on endless wars the va which i brought from a horror show to high approval never a fan of john cindy can have sleepy joe trump has had a fraught relationship with members of john mccains family since he disparaged the arizona senator during his 2016 campaign but the mccains have stopped short of endorsing trumps rivals until now my husband john lived by a code country first we are republicans yes but americans foremost theres only one candidate in this race who stands up for our values as a nation and that is joebiden mccain tweeted joe and i dont always agree on the issues and i know he and john certainly had some passionate arguments but he is a good and honest man he will lead us with dignity she wrote cindy mccains backing could help biden appeal to republicans disaffected with the gop president and give the former vice president a boost in arizona a crucial swing state that mccain represented in congress for 35 years hes remained a revered figure since his 2018 death from complications of a brain tumor particularly with the independent voters whom biden is courting biden told donors on tuesday evening that mccain’s endorsement was coming “because of what trump talks about how my son and john and others who are heroes who served their country you know he said they’re ‘losers suckers’” he will be a commander in chief that the finest fighting force in the history of the world can depend on because he knows what it is like to send a child off to fight mccain also tweeted on tuesday biden was referring to comments trump reportedly made mocking the american war dead trump has denied making the remarks first reported through anonymous sources by the atlantic but many of the comments were later confirmed by the associated press cindy mccain had not initially been expected to offer an explicit endorsement of biden but she had already gone to bat for his presidential run she lent her voice to a video that aired during the democratic national convention and was focused on biden’s close friendship with her late husband john mccain was assigned to be a military aide for biden then a senator during an overseas trip and their families formed an enduring friendship they later shared a grim bond over glioblastoma an aggressive cancer that killed bidens son beau three years before mccain succumbed to the same disease john mccain said in 2016 that he couldn’t support trump or democrat hillary clinton in 2016 citing trumps demeaning comments about women “it’s not pleasant for me to renounce the nominee of my party” mccain said during a debate as he sought his sixth term in the senate “he won the nomination fair and square” a navy pilot john mccain was shot down over north vietnam in 1967 he was captured beaten and held prisoner for more than five years refusing to be released ahead of other american service members during his 2016 campaign trump said of mccain “he’s not a war hero he was a war hero because he was captured i like people who weren’t captured” mccain later angered trump with his dramatic thumbsdown vote against repealing obama’s health care law the mccains’ daughter meghan mccain has been outspoken about the pain she feels when the president disparages her father biden consoled meghan mccain on an appearance on “the view” after her father was diagnosed with the cancer that eventually took his life she has said biden often reaches out to her to offer support after losing his own son beau to the same cancer in 2015 trump wasn’t invited to john mccain’s funeral “she didn’t support donald trump in 2016 either and he’s president now said trump campaign spokesman tim murtaugh

preliminary findings of voter fraud in the 2016 election and that it would be destroying confidential voter data initially collected for president trump’s controversial voter fraud commission which was disbanded on january 3 the revelation stands in stark contrast to previous comments made by both trump and former commission vice chair and kansas secretary of state kris kobach who claimed in an interview with rightwing outlet breitbart one week ago that all investigation work would be “handed off” to the department of homeland security dhs implying that democrats were becoming “uncomfortable” with how much republicans had discovered thus far trump also claimed previously that the commission — created in may 2017 and charged with identifying “vulnerabilities in voting systems” that could lead to fraud — had uncovered “substantial” findings which would be handed over to dhs tuesday’s court filing contradicted those claims “the commission did not create any

ongoing and that the disbanded commission had uncovered a swath of evidence that was being hampered by “leftist” groups according to breitbart on january 3 kobach told the outlet that moving forward he would be “working closely with the white house and dhs to ensure the investigations continue” “what’s happening is a tactical shift where the mission of the commission is being handed off to homeland security without the stonewalling by democrats” he said “…they have absolutely no interest in stopping voter fraud it’s truly extraordinary that one party in our system has made clear that they don’t care” he added that “some people on the left were getting uncomfortable about how much we were finding out” kriskobach1787 the bottom line is voter fraud is a problem going forward and i

advising dhs in a formal or informal manner” a dhs spokesperson told the kansas city star “of course if an issue were to arise we would work with him in his official capacity as the kansas secretary of state as we do with any secretary of state and other state and local officials” in response kobach insisted that the white house had promised he would be involved in the process moving forward “i can tell you this i was informed by the white house when the president made his final decision that they wanted me to be working closely with the president and this team …and that team is both the

al1qzk,2019-01-29 18:33:03,Democrats,No Republican senators have signed onto a bill to give federal contractors backpay after the shutdown,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/29/18200559/government-shutdown-contractors-back-pay,progress18,1223,51,maine sen susan collins is the first — and so far only — republican senator to sign on to a bill guaranteeing back pay for federal contractors in the wake of the 35day government shutdown the bill would ensure that contractors who typically haven’t received back pay in the past also get paychecks for the time they missed as a result of the stalemate sen tina smith dmn who is leading the legislation has now gained support for the bill from more than 35 democrats but no republicans had officially backed up the bill until this point according to a spokesperson for smith smith and her colleagues say they are going to keep reaching across the aisle with the hopes that collins’s support could very well open the door for others to join her “i don’t know of any republican opposition to this” sen chris van hollen dmd a bill cosponsor told vox van hollen and smith are aiming for the legislation to be included in any final spending package that funds the government before the february 15 deadline in the house rep ayanna pressley dma has also introduced a companion bill many federal contractors unlike other government employees are not expected to get back pay for the paychecks they missed out on during the multiweek shutdown because they work for thirdparty companies that the government pays for their services contractors don’t get paid when these services aren’t used during past shutdowns contractors have been forced to simply chalk up this gap in pay as a loss as many as 580000 contractors including cafeteria workers security guards and it consultants could be affected by the shutdown in this way according to nyu public service professor paul light depending on the company they work for some contractors may have received their pay uninterrupted during the shutdown for those who did see breaks in their wages it’s a gaping hole they’re being asked to recover from with little recourse “thirtyfive days is a historically long shutdown” says van hollen “the economic pain and damage was more severe than past ones there are a lot of people who were left out in the cold for no fault of their own” contractors have told vox that they struggled with bills for everything from medication to baby formula to child care during the shutdown as the washington post reported some contractors even saw their health insurance coverage put on pause because their employers weren’t able to cover worker premiums while the shutdown is now over its effects are expected to have an outsize impact on many workers for months to come what the senate bill would do the senate bill which has been dubbed the fair compensation for lowwage contractor employees act would require federal agencies to work directly with companies that contract to them in order to provide back pay for the employees caught up in the shutdown as smith has explained federal agencies have already allocated money in their budgets to cover contractor costs that have not been doled out because of the shutdown her bill would simply ask these agencies to pay out what they would have spent anyway “if you think about it they’re paying people for work they would have done but for the shutdown” smith said “in many cases that money was already budgeted it just hasn’t been spent” the bill is especially focused on providing full back pay for lowwage individuals but would also offer some compensation for higherincome earners according to smith’s spokesperson agencies could provide workers up to 965 per week in back pay if the bill passes the legislation would also create a special account to pay out these funds the senator said noting that it expands a mechanism that already exists for reimbursing contractors for shutdown costs agencies could actually pay contractors without any legislation while legislation could help codify the practice of repaying federal contractors after a shutdown agencies could actually directly pay out these contracts without any legislation at all according to a union representative “the public should be aware that agencies do in fact have the ability to immediately and singlehandedly provide workers back pay without forcing members of congress into the long and uphill battle of passing legislation” said jaime contreras a vice president of 32bj seiu a union representing building services workers “in this way federal agencies are holding a lifeline to rescue workers who are drowning in bills through no fault of their own agencies must fulfill their moral and financial obligation to repay workers for a shutdown these men and women had nothing to do with” the office of management and budget could direct agencies to examine their budgets and determine how much it would cost to cover contractor wages that were not paid out during the shutdown the union representative added prior to the end of the shutdown house and senate democrats had urged omb to do just that “government contracts typically have provisions to modify the terms of the contract” they wrote “federal contracting officers should use these provisions to work with contractors to provide back pay for employees who lost wages as a result of the government shutdown” omb did not immediately respond to a request for comment and van hollen said lawmakers haven’t heard back from the agency as things stand right now both the administration and congress are leaving contractors in the lurch

They want Trump’s taken away. And they might succeed.,https://www.thedailybeast.com/they-want-trumps-liquor-license-yankedand-they-just-might-win,therecordcorrected,1217,92,five washington dc religious leaders and two retired or inactive dcbased judges have launched an effort designed to force president trump to fully disengage from the trump family business while serving in office and unlike other challenges this one has a very narrow precise and attainable target the trump international hotel dc’s liquor license which trump continues to hold personally despite having purportedly stepped back from trump organization business dealings according to joan goldfrank a retired magistrate judge of the superior court of the district of columbia henry h kennedy jr an inactive senior us district court judge for the district of columbia rev william lamar iv the senior pastor at the metropolitan african methodist episcopal church in washington dc rev jennifer butler the founding executive director of faith in public life and the former chair of the white house council on faith and neighborhood partnerships rev dr timothy tee boddie a baptist preacher rabbi jack moline a conservative jewish rabbi and rabbi aaron potek an orthodox jewish rabbi all residents of dc the trump hotel’s liquor license should be revoked that is because trump remains the owner of the licensee—the trump international—and dc law requires an owner to be of good character” the complainants argue that trump having been accused of sexual assault by at least 16 women his foundation continuing to be dogged by allegations of impropriety his failure to pay contractors money owed his maintenance of relationships with alleged criminals and his attitudes toward minority groups and regarding race relations collectively mean he falls short of the legal “good character” standard “ but if the complaint does result in trump’s license being yanked the complainants expect to see it replicated elsewhere—and trump should probably prepare for that ” if you think this sounds crazy get this the district of columbia alcohol beverage control board just might wind up agreeing former board member mafara hobson is siding with the complainants and urging “an immediate investigation and subsequent hearing to determine if the hotel is in compliance and worthy of the privilege to hold a liquor license in the nation’s capital” that requested investigation is currently ongoing meaning this isn’t just a random request filed and sitting in an inbox somewhere gathering dust trump’s license could indeed be pulled something that would no doubt irk him greatly and cause major financial issues for the hotel observers of the ongoing war between the president and his detractors might regard the complaint as the ultimate in clever trolling designed to mess with the president’s head—and the latter part of that statement may be true trump is famously boastful of his wealth and business success despite four bankruptcies alcohol sales form a solid financial foundation for hotels and restaurants it’s easy to imagine that the loss of the liquor license could seriously damage the financial health of the trump international despite the hotel’s popularity with lobbyists insiders and foreign governments trying to curry favor with the trump administration in turn the hotel performing badly could further undermine perceptions of trump as a successful businessman which were to some degree already knocked back during the 2016 primary joshua a levy counsel to the complainants says trump need not jeopardize the financial wellbeing of the property however by allowing the complaint and investigation to proceed further “mr trump put his character at issue when he certified that he is the owner of the licensee” says levy “if he doesn’t want to adjudicate his own character he can transfer his ownership to someone who as opposed to mr trump can meet the statutory requirements otherwise he should have to show cause why his hotel should keep the license being president does not excuse mr trump from compliance with the law” in other words to avoid the entire problem trump could simply make someone else—perhaps a less ethically encumbered family member or business associate—owner but if trump is to retain his license not only will he need to show evidence of “good character”—something trump critics might wryly suggest he could do by leveraging his evangelical backers to try to make his case mr levy says the board itself will need to show cause why the trump international’s liquor license should not be revoked having regard to the “good character” requirement pertaining to the licensee’s owner otherwise put the board will have to go to bat for trump that may be a tough sell in dc where trump is wildly unpopular having managed to win a mere 4 percent of the vote in 2016 adding to the potential complexity facing trump is the fact that members of the board are appointed by dc’s mayor and confirmed by dc’s council—all of whom can be lobbied but lobbying the board itself is according to a backer of the effort not typically done will the scheme work despite the fact that trump is hardly a beloved figure in dc and it’s an arm of the dc local government that needs to make the decision the board could of course decide to let him keep his license that would signal businessfriendliness that some have seen as waning in the district lately with voters having passed an initiative to raise the hourly wage of tipped workers but if the complaint does result in trump’s license being yanked the complainants expect to see it replicated elsewhere—and trump should probably prepare for that in the initial application filed to obtain the liquor license trump said he owned controlled or “was associated” with 19 further businesses that held liquor licenses nationwide including a bevy associated with his golf courses some of those are said to be in locations where standards meet or exceed those of dc’s “good character” requirement potentially putting them at risk for the same sort of licensejeopardizing complaints while the dc complainants are not pursuing action with respect to these other liquor licenses they believe their complaint may be replicated elsewhere by other local community and judicial leaders who take issue with trump’s apparent continued involvement in his family business his character and ethics of course that is assuming the complaint actually succeeds in costing trump his liquor license in dc or that he does not take note of the complaint and preemptively transfer the license to someone of more obviously “good character” in order to avoid the hassle the latter of those end results would of course be a good outcome in the view of the complainants per mr levy “the rule of law still matters character still matters” nevertrumpers and the resistance may argue that’s a quaint notion that fell by the wayside with trump’s inauguration as president however the dc liquor board might end up proving them wrong—at least in this single very narrow specific legal area

president barack obama over his handling of the ebola outbreak contending that obama had failed to lead and took a serious threat far too lightly six years later perdue a firstterm senator is on the ballot again in georgia and now is running on the same ticket as a president struggling to get control of a virus far more deadly to the country but perdue has praised donald trump even as the president has repeatedly downplayed the coronavirus contended it would disappear called on states to be liberated as they were trying to isolate from the virus was late to embrace mask wearing and has falsely claimed that more testing is the lone reason for more cases its a totally different situation perdue told cnn last week when asked about his criticism of obama in 2014 asked if he was concerned about trumps handling of the crisis perdue said no i think given the uncertainty that we had at the very beginning weve done everything we could right now he sees declaring covid19 as the enemy were not fighting among ourselves were all together democrats and republicans should be fighting this virus perdues comments are a reflection of how gop senators in difficult reelection races recognize that their fate is tied in large part to the presidents standing heading into november and with polls showing voters more concerned about the coronavirus than any other issue republicans need trump to bolster his performance on the pandemic and have calculated that they must show solidarity with a president who deeply values loyalty in order to win over the gop base in north carolina trump has seen his standing erode hes down 7 points to former vice president joe biden among registered voters in a new nbc newsmarist college poll and down 17 points to the presumptive democratic nominee over the handling of the coronavirus the same poll shows republican sen thom tillis down 9 points against his challenger democrat cal cunningham before he won his first term in 2014 tillis railed against obama over ebola concerns as he battled the late democratic sen kay hagan in a fiercely contested race its just another example of where this president and sen hagan just have not worked on a comprehensive strategy tillis said in october 2014 calling for a travel ban from three western african nations asked last week about his criticism of obama but praise of trump tillis said of the democratic president there were problems he needed to surge its a very different story the ebola epidemic claimed the lives of more than 11000 people worldwide almost all of them in west africa just four people were diagnosed with the virus in the united states according to the centers for disease control and prevention and two of them died by contrast the coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 147000 people in the united states with more than 42 million cases in the country the president has made a number of good moves tillis said when asked if he has confidence in trumps handling of the current crisis while also praising north carolina democratic gov roy cooper when youre in the middle of a crisis like this i dont think its productive to criticize everybody its a very difficult job and lives are on the line trump has for his part praised tillis good job youve done trump said singling out tillis on monday at an event in morrisville north carolina republicans have joined the white house in defending trumps response pointing to his restrictions in february of foreign nationals entering the united states from china and later from european countries and they are campaigning on the roughly 3 trillion in federal stimulus congress approved on a bipartisan basis to respond to the crisis so far in 2014 gop candidates also pushed for a travel ban from west africa where the ebola virus originated the obama administration eventually directed travelers from west africa to fly to only to a small number of us airports that had taken additional precautions to screen for the disease in 2020 few republicans have been willing to raise any concerns about shortcomings in the federal response or trumps own rhetoric which has often downplayed the severity of the virus including recently as cases surged across the sun belt and other parts of the country asked last week if he had confidence in the trump administrations handling of the virus gop sen cory gardner of colorado pushed back im not going to play political pundit for you gardner said when asked if he agreed with trumps claim that the federal government had done a great job in dealing with the crisis asked again how he would characterize the administrations response gardner said you want me to be a democrat pundit im not going to do it only two people ever carried ebola to the us a traveler from liberia who died in a dallas hospital and who infected two nurses who cared for him and an american doctor who traveled home to new york before he knew he was infected and who did not spread the virus to anyone else republican senate candidates in competitive races across the country sharply criticized the obama administrations response to the health care threat at the time in october 2014 thenrep gardner whacked the federal response during a debate against democratic sen mark udall perhaps the cdc should quit spending money on things like jazzercise urban gardening and massage therapy and direct that money to where its appropriate in protecting the health of the american people he said in maine sen susan collins said during a debate that same month that the administrations ebola policy was not only a moving target but a disaster because the president has always been one step behind in another debate she praised obama for restricting travel saying he had made a good first step and advocated further temporary travel restrictions collins has been more critical than most of her gop colleagues about trumps handling of the coronavirus contending previously that the presidents response has been very uneven many republicans recognize the difficult position theyre in given they need to appeal to the trump base but also win over biden voters its a fine line for downballot republicans running in states and districts that favor biden said whit ayres a top republican pollster it will be a fine line to walk to receive 100 of the trump voters and some significant share of the biden voters the pandemic is also a central issue in montanas us senate race where democratic gov steve bullock is mounting a tough challenge to gop sen steve daines asked last week if he had confidence in the presidents handling of the coronavirus daines said he has been pushing for billions in funding for vaccines and therapeutics and that hes very pleased to see trump with a similar focus were not going to stop this pandemic and stop the course to an economic crisis until we have a vaccine ready for the american people and these breakthrough therapeutics daines told cnn im very pleased to see his focus there and working with my efforts daines didnt respond to a question about whether he agrees with trumps repeated claim that testing for covid19 is overrated just watched bash

Them",https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/fifty-thousand-americans-dead-in-the-coronavirus-pandemic-and-a-president-who-refuses-to-mourn-them,wenchette,1192,63,in just the past few days president trump has blamed immigrants china the “fake news” and of course “the invisible enemy” of the coronavirus for america’s present troubles he has opined extemporaneously about his plans to hold a grand fourth of july celebration on the national mall and has announced that he planted a tree on the white house lawn in honor of earth day he has offered his opinion on matters small and large bragged about himself as “the king of ventilators” and spent much time lamenting the pandemicinflicted passing of what he invariably and inaccurately calls “the greatest economy in the history of the world” despite the flood of words though what has struck me the most this week is what trump does not talk about the mounting toll of those who have died in this crisis so voluble that he regularly talks well past dinnertime at his nightly briefings the president somehow never seems to find time to pay tribute to those who have been lost aside from reading an occasional scripted line or two at the start of his lengthy press conferences or a brief mention of a friend in new york who died of the disease soon after calling him at the white house “he said ‘i tested positive’ four days later he was dead” the president recounted “so this is a tough deal” it was not exactly the prayerful if often politically expedient mournfulness americans generally expect of their elected leaders trump for the most part dispenses even with the ritualistic clichés that other politicians regardless of party or creed have always offered in times of crisis but the numbers are the numbers and notwithstanding trump’s relentless happy talk the coronavirus epidemic has as of this week already produced some fifty thousand american dead this is not needless to say a bestcase scenario or anything close to it just a few weeks ago a survey of scientific experts predicted fortyseven thousand us dead by the beginning of may according to the web site fivethirtyeight instead fortyseven thousand deaths were recorded by this wednesday april 22nd well before the experts had anticipated on april 8th a leading model at the university of washington had revised its projections downward to forecast a total of sixty thousand american deaths by the beginning of august but the nation now looks to hit that number by may 1st meaning that just a few days from now more americans will have died from covid19 than the entire toll from the vietnam war meanwhile trump talks of reopening the country and of the “tremendous strides against this invisible enemy” you would think that no amount of trumpian misdirection could disguise the awful fact that america has more confirmed coronavirus deaths than any country in the world and that many of them might have been prevented by earlier more decisive government action when the president was denying that the coronavirus even presented a threat to the united states but trump is trying his hardest to ignore the covid19 deaths to the extent that he discusses those who have died he tends to do so largely in selfjustifying explicitly political terms framing the pandemic as an externally imposed catastrophe that would have been much much worse without him earlier this deadly spring trump was briefly scared into a more sombre public presentation by projections that showed hundreds of thousands or even millions of us deaths if no preventative actions were taken now he cites the absence of those worstcase scenarios as proof of his own brilliant handling of the crisis the numbers of dead citizens he throws about meanwhile seem to be abstractions to a president who believes that even the subject of mass death is all about him “if we didn’t do the moves that we made you would have had a million a million and a half two million people dead” he said on monday “you would have had ten to twenty to twentyfive times more people dead than all of the people that we’ve been watching that’s not acceptable the fifty thousand is not acceptable it’s so horrible but can you imagine multiplying that out by twenty or more it’s not acceptable” trump did not pause to offer any sort of regret or sorrow and instead claimed that the entire death toll in the united states would end up around fifty or sixty thousand as a result of his heroic moves of course this was not true that is essentially how many have already passed away honoring the dead has long been one of the tests of american presidential leadership abraham lincoln’s gettysburg address was after all not just another political speech but a remembrance of those who were killed in the bloodiest single battle of the civil war in which some fifty thousand americans became casualties and about eight thousand died twentyfive years ago this week bill clinton’s lipbitingly empathetic response to the oklahoma city bombing in which a white supremacist blew up a federal building and killed a hundred and sixtyeight people was seen as a key moment of his tenure he was dubbed the “mournerinchief” at a time when he was languishing politically that speech is often said to have saved his presidency more recently barack obama wept from the white house lectern in speaking about the deaths of schoolchildren in newtown connecticut and gave arguably the speech of his lifetime in charleston south carolina in 2015 singing “amazing grace” as he mourned at a funeral service for nine africanamericans killed by a white supremacist at a church massacre even those presidents who aren’t particularly good at speechifying—think of the two george bushes—have considered public commiseration amid national tragedy part of the job description have we ever had a president just take a pass on human empathy even of the manufactured politically clichéd kind trump’s departure from normal behavior is often most painfully evident during his nightly briefings when his persistent disregard for the dead stands in stark contrast to the manner of others in his administration dr deborah birx the state department official who has been named white house coördinator for the pandemic response often mentions the human toll of the disease and thanks the medical caregivers risking their lives on wednesday vicepresident mike pence began his brief remarks with a nod to the “loss of more than fortyseven thousand of our countrymen” it was just the sort of thing you would expect pence to say and yet notable for how different it sounded compared with the president trump began that very same briefing by saying “our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working” it is he said “very exciting even today watching and seeing what’s happening” what was happening though was another day on which more than two thousand americans died of the coronavirus a fact that trump did not mention we know what a normal president would do and say at such a time he would comfort the afflicted weep tears of sadness whether real or not he would rally the country or at least seek to it is hard to write about the absence of something but especially necessary in this case with a president like trump who has relentlessly used his public platform to discourage the contemplation of how deadly the disease has proved his fear of the political consequences to himself that such contemplation might engender is painfully transparent on thursday i left my house for the first time since my onceaweek socially distanced trip to the grocery store a couple days earlier and drove through the empty streets of washington dc passing the shuttered headquarters of massive federal agencies and the silent white bulk of trump’s executive mansion everywhere i looked there were flags flying at the top of their flagpoles and few if any people determined as he is to avoid any kind of reckoning trump has not even ordered american flags lowered in tribute to the dead although individual governors have decided to in new jersey governor phil murphy did so in early april as did governor andrew cuomo in new york “we recognize those who have been lost to this terrible illness and all those affected by it many families cannot hold funerals for their loved ones at this time by doing this we remind them that their losses are not forgotten” murphy said in a statement announcing the move trump who has in the past personally asked for the flags to be lowered after a shooting or a politician’s death can’t even bring himself to do this much for victims of the coronavirus

i1z1je,2020-08-01 23:22:24,Democrats,Trump and Kushner Should Be Prosecuted for Crimes Against Humanity,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/08/01/trump-and-kushner-must-be-prosecuted-for-crimes-against-humanity/,,1196,37,the white houseflickr last month i wrote that president trump had admitted to a crime against humanity it was true the president had openly bragged about deliberately slowing down covid19 testing for political gain thereby causing the deaths of untold numbers of americans to make himself look better it is a monstrous crime for which he has not yet been held accountable but a new report from vanity fair implicates both trump and his soninlaw jared kushner of an unspeakable horror orders of magnitude greater instead of implementing a comprehensive and aggressive national testing plan as originally recommended by the white house coronavirus task force kushner scuttled it the president and his soninlaw were instead content to allow tens of thousands of americans die as long as they were mostly people of color and hailing from democratic states and counties not only that they saw it as a political opportunity to both cull the numbers of opposing voters and lay blame on democratic governors at the same time against that background the prospect of launching a largescale national plan was losing favor said one public health expert in frequent contact with the white house’s official coronavirus task force most troubling of all perhaps was a sentiment the expert said a member of kushner’s team expressed that because the virus had hit blue states hardest a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically “the political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to democratic states that they could blame those governors and that would be an effective political strategy” said the expert that logic may have swayed kushner “it was very clear that jared was ultimately the decision maker as to what plan was going to come out” the expert said should we believe this report maggie haberman of the new york times casually confirmed the gist of it which only raises further questions about why the times did not report with more alarm on the details this is a wellreported look into some of what went wrong it’s also worth noting that treating the coronavirus as a blue state problem was a fairly widespread approach in the west wing httpstcowdgk8cazok — maggie haberman maggienyt july 31 2020 if this is true–and there is very little reason to doubt its veracity despite the white house press secretary’s denials–it would constitute perhaps the greatest crime against humanity of any president in american history andrew jackson’s trail of tears was more deliberately vicious and murderous george w bush’s immoral war of choice in iraq killed more people overall but no american president has ever betrayed his oath of office more profoundly than in deliberately allowing the deaths of more than 150000 of his own fellow citizens and counting for partisan political gain we even lack the vocabulary to describe it “gross negligence” doesn’t reach the level of the crime “murder” is lurid but frankly not comprehensive enough in scope to describe the death of 150000 “treason” comes to mind when considering that the president of the united states knowingly allowed 150000 americans to die because they were mostly his political opponents–but despite his russia entanglements there is no direct evidence he did so on behalf of a foreign power but there’s another option “genocide” the known racial bias of the deaths overlaps with the political bias–black and brown americans tend to be democrats and live in democratic areas and are disproportionately falling victim to the virus–which in turn would make “genocide” the most compelling way to describe what trump and kushner have done genocide yes it sounds preposterous it sounds like the hyperbole of the deeply unserious but what else can you call it no word is perfect but the crime must have a name that fits the enormous scope of its evil it must describe what actually happened and what happened is that the president and his soninlaw deliberately allowed 150000 and counting americans to die of a pandemic because it would mostly kill off their political opponents because it would kill off mostly poor people of color because they thought they could gain an upper hand by blaming opposing governors but they thought it would advantage them politically it’s like a plot out of a bad action movie with a comic book villain except it’s real life and those villains are still governing and making decisions when the founders named “high crimes and misdemeanors” as the basis for impeaching a president they chose the phrase because it was deliberately vague it would be impossible to write a law to cover every possible abuse of power by a deranged executive they expected the congress to respect its own authority and the health of the country enough to know when a relevant “high crime” or “misdemeanor” had taken place the problem now is that this president has already been impeached there isn’t time or appetite to impeach him again and the senate controlled by the president’s party refuses to act out of political cowardice and selfinterest moreover the phrase “high crime” doesn’t really do justice to the scope of the evil of which the president is reportedly guilty this is a crime against humanity a crime so profound we may not have a law to cover it a crime with international implications one so vast it may require an international court but somehow some way it must be prosecuted the majority of americans the ones not enthralled by conservative infotainment and the trump propaganda machine are suffering from years of collective trauma and looking forward to the november election as a means of escape one can hardly blame them nor would many be to blame for wanting to put this entire era behind us and never look back but assuming democracy remains intact and trump is driven from office this enormous crime cannot be forgotten it cannot be ignored there must be accountability for this genocide the greatest crime in american history

the president but threequarters of republicans said they do when it comes to the news media twothirds of democrats trust the information they hear coming from them independents were split and republicans overwhelmingly said they do not trust what theyre hearing from the media having significant chunks of the country either not believing their president who controls the federal governments

a unified message coming out of washington or even from the white house said barbara carvalho director of the marist poll referring in particular to the partisan divide there was some confusion initially — if this was really a health crisis or an economic crisis she noted that the differences by party really speak to the fact of how were getting our information a lack of faith in the federal government trumps reversal appears warranted given that americans faith in the federal governments response is on the decline americans are split on whether they think the federal government is doing enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus just 46 say it is down from 61 in february again though theres a big political divide many more democrats now say the federal government isnt taking

ah5ehf,2019-01-18 03:55:10,Democrats,Mitch McConnell is the problem.,https://theweek.com/articles/818247/mitch-mcconnell-problem,Ghdust2,1179,49,the us house has impeached two us presidents in the past — bill clinton and andrew johnson — and prepared articles of impeachment against another — richard nixon the senate declined to convict the former two in nixons case it didnt get the chance before he resigned the clinton impeachment was so disastrous that few lawmakers are eager to return to the constitutionally prescribed remedy for egregiously bad or corrupt presidents but as this partial government shutdown approaches its onemonth mark it seems impeachment isnt such a fringe idea anymore in the march issue of the atlantic senior editor and former history teacher yoni appelbaum makes a surprisingly persuasive argument that congress has an urgent duty to impeach president trump before he can further undermine the very foundations of americas constitutional democracy impeachment is important to pursue even if the senate fails to remove trump appelbaum says and senate majority leader mitch mcconnells rky republican majority has shown little will to break with the president but doesnt this point to an easier better remedy to this debacle just ditch mcconnell among his arguments appelbaum says trump has drastically undermined the presidency federal judges consistently overturn his executive orders and his own political appointees boast to reporters or brag in anonymous opeds that they routinely work to counter his policies he writes congress is contemplating actions on trade and defense that will hem in the president but contemplation isnt the same thing as action and mcconnell isnt doing much of anything to wrest back the institutional power congress has incrementally shed for 100 years in fact as wunderkind rep alexandria ocasiocortez dny noted on wednesday mcconnell could almost singlehandedly end the shutdown tomorrow if he brought housepassed legislation up for a vote — then if necessary up for a possible vetooverride in late october christopher r browning a historian who specializes in nazi germany and the holocaust noted the similarities between trumps governance and the interwar period and the rise of fascism in europe in the new york review of books trump seems intent on withdrawing the us from the entire post–world war ii structure of interlocking diplomatic military and economic agreements and organizations that have preserved peace stability and prosperity since 1945 and his naive and narcissistic confidence in his own powers of personal diplomacy with the authoritarians he openly admires recalls the hapless neville chamberlain but just as adolf hitler came to power only with the aide of weimar german president paul von hindenburg whose conservatives believed they could ultimately control hitler while enjoying the benefits of his popular support trump isnt working in a vacuum browning writes and if the us has someone whom historians will look back on as the gravedigger of american democracy it is mitch mcconnell he explains mcconnell stoked the hyperpolarization of american politics to make the obama presidency as dysfunctional and paralyzed as he possibly could as with parliamentary gridlock in weimar congressional gridlock in the us has diminished respect for democratic norms allowing mcconnell to trample them even more nowhere is this vicious circle clearer than in the obliteration of traditional precedents concerning judicial appointments one can predict that henceforth no significant judicial appointments will be made when the presidency and the senate are not controlled by the same party mcconnell and our dysfunctional and disrespected congress have now ensured an increasingly dysfunctional and disrespected judiciary and the constitutional balance of powers among the three branches of government is in peril christopher browning the new york review of books trump is clearly pushing the limits of executive authority revealing longheld bedrock tenets of the presidency to be mere custom and tradition and while impeaching trump would be terrible for trump as appelbaum details it would also be a new strain on this hyperpolarized country on the flip side a vigorous legislative branch would be salubrious for american democracy a proud congress would take this opportunity to reclaim some of its lost prerogative redefine the relationship between the intended coequal executive and the legislative branches of government and check trumps worst impulses in this effort senate republicans would have a willing partner in house speaker nancy pelosi dcalif true a republican senate not led by mitch mcconnell still probably wouldnt override trumps veto of a bill protecting americas public lands or try to tackle climate change but it might surely quash misguided trade wars demand qualified cabinet appointees stop trump from pulling out of nato or other alliances that undergird americas pole position in the world pecking order and prevent vanity government shutdowns mcconnells deputy sen john cornyn rtexas knows that trumps proposed wall along the texas border would be a wasteful landgrabbing boondoggle maybe hed do something about that theres no mechanism for impeaching a senator only expelling one but mcconnell is up for reelection in 2020 — and republicans can replace him as their leader any time they want someone a little bolder and less deferential to trump will they do that probably not unless they become convinced that hes leading them into the political wilderness but thats still more likely than a twothirds majority of this senate convicting trump of high crimes and misdemeanors editors note this article originally mischaracterized the house of representatives impeachment efforts against richard nixon it has since been corrected we regret the error

2016.",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/mueller-report-internet-research-agency-detailed-2016,Manny12,1169,116,the mueller report clearly describes how russian trolls reached millions of people on facebook were quoted in major newspapers as real americans and even organized rallies win mcnamee getty images attorney general william barr center speaks about the release of the redacted version of the mueller report at the department of justice on april 18 special counsel robert mueller’s report on russian interference in the 2016 election and the trump campaign provides one of the most detailed looks at how russia’s internet research agency — the infamous kremlinlinked troll farm — tried to hijack the 2016 election and swing the vote in favor of donald trump the report which concludes that trump didn’t commit a crime but “also does not exonerate him of obstruction” gives us a clear and exhaustive look at the scope focus and results of the ira’s efforts the agency learned how to use platforms like facebook and twitter over the span of four years by the end it used analytical tools and the builtin network effect of massive social media platforms to create large artificial grassroots political organizations that were aggressively targeting both republicans and democrats the ira was able to reach up to 126 million americans on facebook via a mixture of fraudulent accounts groups and advertisements the report says twitter accounts it created were portrayed as real american voices by major news outlets it was even able to hold reallife rallies mobilizing hundreds of people at a time in major cities like philadelphia and miami fake online personas were able to communicate with members of the trump campaign — who were unaware they were ever communicating with foreign nationals here’s everything we know about russian interference from the report it started in 2014 according to mueller’s report the ira began creating fake facebook accounts and small groups as early as 2014 “ira employees operated social media accounts and group pages designed to attract us audiences” the report reads “these groups and accounts which addressed divisive us political and social issues falsely claimed to be controlled by us activists the lines up with what we already knew about the ira’s activity one of its first largescale misinformation projects was the columbian chemicals plant explosion hoax in september 2014 when ira members created a completely fake explosion at a chemical plant in louisiana “the perpetrators didn’t just doctor screenshots from cnn they also created fully functional clones of the websites of louisiana tv stations and newspapers” the new york times wrote about the hoax the ira consolidated all of its us operations into one department called the “translator” department which appears to have operated like a typical digital media startup with different agents focusing on specific platforms monitoring analytics and even graphic designers about a dozen people known as “specialists” would run an account at a time the ira’s activity wasn’t confined to social media either ira employees traveled to the united states on intelligencegathering missions in 2014 “four ira employees applied to the us department of state to enter the united states while lying about the purpose of their trip and claiming to be four friends who had met at a party” the report reads “ultimately two ira employeesanna bogacheva and aleksandra krylovareceived visas and entered the united states on june 4 2014” the ira was on pretty much every platform at first the ira focused its activity on facebook youtube and twitter later tumblr and instagram accounts were created in the beginning russian trolls were manning only fake individual accounts by 2015 however they began creating larger groups and pages finally they attempted to flex their network effect to hold reallife rallies according to mueller’s report the facebook groups were particularly popular by the time facebook deactivated them in 2017 the russiacontrolled group united muslims of america had over 300000 followers the dont shoot us group had over 250000 followers the being patriotic facebook group had over 200000 followers and the secured borders facebook group had over 130000 followers facebook a post from an iracontrolled facebook page called secured borders ira facebook accounts posted about already divisive social issues like black lives matter and the tea party and even privately messaged other real users “in total the iracontrolled facebook accounts made over 80000 posts before their deactivation in august 2017 and these posts reached at least 29 million us persons and ‘may have reached an estimated 126 million people’” the report reads on twitter it focused on two strategies growing fake accounts and then using a botnet of automated accounts to amplify them ira “specialists” tweeted publicly but also were direct messaging people behind the scenes last spring tumblr announced that it had uncovered and terminated 84 accounts linked to the internet research agency according to findings from researcher jonathan albright and buzzfeed news trolls were using tumblr in similar ways as other platforms they posed as black activists and generated hundreds of thousands of interactions for content that ranged from calling hillary clinton a “monster” to supporting bernie sanders and decrying racial injustice and police violence in the us russian trolls had some of the best luck on instagram based on the report ira instagram accounts had hundreds of thousands of us followers russia was controlling 170 instagram accounts that posted 120000 pieces of content during a twoyear period “collectively the iras social media accounts reached tens of millions of us persons” the report reads the iras tweets got a lot attention last year twitter publicly identified 3814 russiacontrolled twitter accounts according to twitter in the 10 weeks leading up to the 2016 us election these accounts posted approximately 175993 tweets about 84 of the content they posted was political according to mueller’s report ira tweets were quoted extensively in us news outlets seventy us outlets were found to have quoted a russiancontrolled twitter account and attributed it to a real person it wasn’t only media attention the trolls were getting mueller’s report names several politicians media personalities and celebrities who were interacting unknowingly with the ira such as former ambassador michael mcfaul roger stone sean hannity kellyanne conway michael flynn jr donald trump jr and president trump one account is mentioned extensively by mueller’s report tengop an account that posed as a member of the tennessee republican party tengop and its backup account l0gop was particularly prolific its l0gop backup even got a response from president trump we love you mr president” l0gop tweeted “thank you for your support miami my team just shared photos from your trump sign waving day yesterday” trump responded “i love you — and there is no question — together we will make america great again twitter the iras main target hillary clinton across all platforms the ira maintained a pretty unified strategy find cultural pressure points target them with memes and posts find likeminded users and use every opportunity to criticize hillary clinton at one point the ira employee moderating a facebook page called “secured borders” was scolded for having a lower number of posts dedicated to criticizing hillary clinton and was reminded it is imperative to intensify criticizing hillary clinton the ira built facebook communities across the political spectrum but targeted clinton in all of them mueller’s report lists conservative groups like being patriotic stop all immigrants secured borders and tea party news” black social justice groups like black matters blacktivist and dont shoot us” lgbtq groups like lgbt united” and religious groups “united muslims of america” “main idea use any opportunity to criticize hillary clinton and the rest except sanders and trump — we support them” ira operators told specialists the ira bought ads the first known ad from the ira that explicitly endorsed the trump campaign was purchased on april 19 2016 it was an instagram ad for an account called “tea party news” and asked users to help “make a patriotic team of young trump supporters” by uploading photos with the hashtag kids4tru in the following months the ira would purchase ads via the facebook groups being patriotic stop all invaders and secured borders facebook a post from an iracontrolled facebook page called black matters the ira also purchased ads posing as real us citizens or entities “some ira employees posing as us persons and without revealing their russian association communicated electronically with individuals associated with the trump campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities including the staging of political rallies” the report reads according to facebook russian agents were able to purchase over 3500 advertisements and spent about 100000 in april 2016 they purchased ads for its account black matters calling for a flash mob to take a photo with hillaryclintonforprison2016 or nohillary2016 there’s no evidence this flash mob ever materialized and the youtube account promoting it has since been taken down but it was in ads like this that the ira focused most of its anticlinton messaging all of the ads purchased about trump were positive another irapurchased ad from march 2016 was a photo of clinton with a caption that read if one day god lets this liar enter the white house as a president — that day would be a real national tragedy department of justice a except from muellers report the ira organized rallies via catfishing by 2016 according to mueller’s findings the ira was becoming increasingly interested in mobilizing its followers physically it was buying ads to organize anticlinton flash mobs and building protrump photo challenges one of the most unsettling things in thursday’s report are the details about how successful russiacontrolled social media accounts became at actually organizing political rallies first they would use spoofed accounts on facebook or twitter to announce an event then they’d privately message the event to real users asking them if they could attend then if they got a bite they’d assign one of these real people to be the event coordinator usually the russian troll would make up some excuse as to why they couldn’t personally attend according to the report the users messaged privately about the events were usually recruited for their social media popularity “the ira recruited us persons from across the political spectrum” the report reads “initially recruitment focused on us persons who could amplify the content posted by the ira” once a real social media user was set up as the coordinator the ira would promote the event to members of the media after the event was over they’d share photos and videos of it across their network of groups and fake accounts mueller said this happened dozens of times with the earliest rally being a confederate rally in november 2015 also these artificial rallies didn’t stop after the election continuing after 2016 attendance apparently varied between just a few protestors but occasionally reaching the hundreds at first the rallies ran the gamut in terms of focus but after june 2016 all of them became focused on the election meuller’s report includes a flyer for a “miners for trump rally held in philadelphia in october 2016 the ira was able to successfully organize three rallies in new york and a series of protrump rallies in florida and pennsylvania at one point the ira used craigslist and an email called “beingpatrioticgmailcom to recruit someone to walk around new york city in a santa suit and trump mask the trump campaign didn’t know it was talking to russians — but it was one of the largest questions going into the report was what if anything trump and his campaign team knew about russian attempts to hijack the american political conversation in the lead up to the 2016 election according to mueller’s report they were duped like the rest of us “in total trump campaign affiliates promoted dozens of tweets posts and other political content created by the ira” the report reads “the investigation did not identify evidence that any us persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the iras interference operation” when the ira decided to create an artificial rally they would recruit a reallife recruiter to act as the ontheground coordinator but would also typically connect with trump’s campaign “some ira employees posing as us persons and without revealing their russian association communicated electronically with individuals associated with the trump campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities including the staging of political rallies” the report reads russian trolls would direct message or email trump campaign officials and ask for things like campaign buttons flyers and posters to make their artificial rallies look more organic by may 2016 the ira were trying to organize enough rallies that they decided to create a twitter account called march rtrump which they then used to promote iraorganized rallies in support of the trump campaign muellers report found no evidence of a similar relationship publicly or privately with the clinton campaign department of justice an excerpt from muellers report

He shouldn't get away with it. -- Trump's public request for Russian help in finding Hillary Clinton’s emails was a violation of US law. There are ways to hold him accountable.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/01/02/trump-broke-law-russia-clinton-emails-hold-him-accountable-column/2449564002/,therecordcorrected,1162,87,fred wertheimer and norman eisen opinion contributors prosecutors triggered a national firestorm last month when they asserted that president donald trump conspired with his exfixer michael cohen to commit campaign finance crimes involving hush money payments to two women but the discussion has overlooked another trump campaign finance offense — one that is even easier to prove because it occurred in plain sight on july 27 2016 trump called on russia to find presidential democratic nominee hillary clinton’s missing emails “russia if you’re listening i hope you’re able to find the 30000 emails that are missing” trump proclaimed he added “i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press” federal campaign finance law prohibits any person from soliciting campaign contributions defined as anything of value to be given to influence an election from a foreign national including a foreign government in asking russia to find clinton’s emails presidential candidate trump violated this statutory prohibition on seeking help from a foreign country to influence an election trump in essence called on a foreign adversary to locate and release something that was of great value to him and his campaign read more commentary no exit americas not only trapped in trumps legal reality show were paying for it trumps lies and corruption disgrace presidential legacies of lincoln and washington how house democrats can save democracy and the rule of law impeach trump asap the law provides that such a solicitation is illegal regardless of whether the person soliciting the help receives anything in return the risks of foreign intrusion in our elections are so great that even asking for help from foreigners without consummation is a crime but in this case on or about the same day that trump solicited help from russia russia made its first attempt to break into servers that hillary clinton’s personal office used that event is laid out in detail in an indictment of russian hackers obtained by special counsel robert mueller trump can hardly claim he could not have seen that coming suspected russian electionrelated hacking was already much in evidence at the time nor can he plead ignorance of the law trump has given sworn affidavits and made other statements that he has deep understanding of campaign finance laws trump was warned about foreign solicitation indeed before his july 27 2016 request of russia trump had been put on notice that it was illegal for his presidential campaign to solicit support from foreign interests on june 29 and july 22 2016 watchdog groups including one led by one of the authors filed complaints with the federal election commission and the justice department respectively against trump’s presidential campaign committee for illegally soliciting financial support from parliamentarians in countries around the world including iceland scotland australia and great britain multiple news organizations had reported that trump’s campaign was violating the ban on foreign solicitations by emailing fundraising solicitations to foreign nationals the trump campaign did not respond to press requests for comments on the fec complaint thencandidate trump selfdescribed as deeply familiar with campaign finance laws and on notice that his campaign committee was illegally soliciting foreign support nonetheless proceeded to publicly request assistance from russia to find information to hurt clinton and help his campaign some may say trump’s invitation was merely campaign rhetoric or hyperbole which should not be criminalized but that is to ignore the plain language of the law and its purpose to protect the united states from the influence of foreign countries in our elections the statute says “it shall be unlawful for … a person to solicit accept or receive a contribution or donation … from a foreign national” in using the word “or” the statute makes plain that the act of solicitation in and of itself is a violation the danger of trump’s words can be seen in the fact that russia took them both seriously and literally justice department says trump cant be indicted if this were an isolated incident that would be one thing but the cohen revelations expose a pattern of campaign finance law violations by trump complete with a tape of him discussing the coverup evidence he knew what he was doing was wrong then there are the many other allegations of illegal conduct including substantial evidence of obstruction of justice the president appears to operate with blatant disdain for the nation’s laws and his alleged violation in soliciting campaign help from russia is only one instance the president should not be immune from accountability for this alleged misconduct federal prosecutors should be free to charge him for any campaign finance offenses grounded in probable cause including if they see fit the july 27 solicitation of russia unfortunately they are currently blocked from doing so by opinions from the justice departments office of legal counsel that a sitting president may not be indicted we join eminent experts in disagreeing with those opinions and this latest possible offense should be one more nail in his coffin trump campaign and business could be charged even though justice is unlikely to change its mind on charging trump next best options are available the trump campaign is legally responsible under principles of vicarious liability for the statements of its head and so could be indicted the russia solicitation could be included in an indictment featuring other counts such as charging the campaign and the trump organization for the separate alleged hush money violations described by cohen no justice department policy prohibits prosecutors from naming the president as an unindicted coconspirator in such an indictment and with a fiveyear statute of limitations he could still be prosecuted for these alleged knowing and willful 2016 offenses should he fail to seek or secure reelection in 2020 campaign finance laws are enacted to protect the american people they do not exist for candidates to choose whether to comply with the laws or not as they see fit no one is above the law — not an ordinary citizen and not the president of the united states president trump must be held accountable for his allegedly illegal activities — for his apparently knowing and

barbaro this is “the daily” music today a times investigation has revealed evidence of a secret russian operation to kill american soldiers in afghanistan — and the failure of the trump administration to act on that evidence i spoke with my colleague eric schmitt one of the reporters who broke the original story about what we know now it’s wednesday july 1 eric how is it that the us first learned that russia was up to something in afghanistan eric schmitt so michael about six months ago or so us commandos working with afghan allies carry out a raid on a taliban safehouse and they made a remarkable discovery they found some 500000 in american money inside this safehouse now to be sure from time to time when they do these kind of raids you find weapons and you find other kinds of things even some money but the military sources that we’ve talked to said they’d never seen such a large haul i mean what would these guys be doing with 500000 how did they get it and what was it going to be used for so this set off a lot of questions and as they conduct other raids the commandos cia other authorities in afghanistan they seize the cell phones of different fighters — taliban fighters — and they start exploiting that to see if there’s any clues in the cell phones that might lead them back to the source of this money but perhaps one of most important things that happens is when they seize a couple of very important senior taliban and talibanrelated figures and of course that’s one of the first things they want to ask these operatives is do you know anything about this money michael barbaro and what do the militants say eric schmitt they had a remarkable story to tell that this was money that they had been paid that they’d been paid by a secretive russian military intelligence unit for the express purpose of killing american british and other coalition forces in afghanistan but these investigators they were searching around for other proof — how to link all this together because of course how do you assess that these taliban guys weren’t telling lies or some kind of disinformation and then investigators learned of something else that sealed the deal that seemed to kind of be the glue that pieced all these disparate parts together and that was intercepts basically electronic intercepts of the financial transactions themselves from this russian military intelligence unit down to the afghans on the ground who are the intermediaries who are basically managing this program for them there and then onto the killers themselves before they were dispatched to target the american forces there essentially it was an electronic paper trail receipts if you will for services asked and services rendered this became a very compelling argument that the military cia and other authorities in afghanistan started putting together michael barbaro and a very serious conclusion because from what you’re describing us intelligence officials are not just putting together a theory that this money was offered to taliban fighters to go after americans — to basically kill them for hire — but that money had actually been paid out to them suggesting that such killings had occurred eric schmitt that’s right this wasn’t just in theory but there was the idea that they’d actually recovered some of the proceeds that the russians had paid the afghans to carry out this mission so obviously the next task was to figure out what deaths may have been actually the result of this campaign michael barbaro and do we have an answer eric schmitt so the military and the intelligence officers working with afghan officials started looking back over different attacks to see which looked suspicious and their attentions focused on one in particular three marines who were killed on a patrol just outside of bagram air base they were patrolling on a normal day when a large car bomb basically blew up and this is something that the military is still determining just what the links were if any to this program this attack but it was suspicious and it may have had the hallmarks of this program and some of the receipts tying back to it michael barbaro and eric in the minds of these intelligence officials who are starting to piece this russian bounty system together why would russia do this i mean why would they pay the taliban to kill us soldiers eric schmitt well michael i think you have to go back in the history of the us and russia and afghanistan essentially to the very end of the cold war where in the late 1980s the cia secretly armed the mujahideen resistance against the soviet union which had invaded and occupied afghanistan for nearly a decade and the united states helped accelerate the departure of soviet soldiers from afghanistan fast forward to after 911 when it’s the us that invades afghanistan russians want a stable government there they don’t like al qaeda any more than the united states does and so for some years there’s actually some cooperation between moscow and washington until a few years ago when president putin of russia starts to become disillusioned with the us plan in afghanistan doesn’t believe it’s going to work and begins — behind the backs of the us — to support the taliban to provide weapons arms the taliban who are still fighting the united states and so we start to see this break where russia is basically looking for ways to inflict pain on the united states and maybe even accelerate the us departure from afghanistan just as decades before the us had done to the soviet union so if you put that framework where russia is now looking for a way to replace the united states as the power inside of afghanistan and humiliate the united states at the same time this bounty program starts to make a little bit of sense if this secretive military intelligence unit can put bounties on the heads of american soldiers increase the number of casualties presumably that would also stir unrest back in the united states — already war weary after two decades of conflict in afghanistan so the russian theory is why not just speed that departure along we take the us‘s place and we humiliate washington and president trump in the process michael barbaro and i guess the reason why russia would turn to a middleman the taliban on this is because it would never want to attack us soldiers on its own in afghanistan just the way the us didn’t want to ever attack russian soldiers directly in the 1980s eric schmitt that’s right you hire basically cutouts to do your dirty work and it’s very hard for the other side to prove that you’re responsible when it’s murky like this and you have afghan intermediaries criminals on the ground and money’s passing back and forth russians would have plausible deniability to say oh perhaps we were just supporting them for other aims there’s no evidence that we were behind this michael barbaro but eric even so even with a middleman cutout as you just called it i have to imagine that this kind of an operation by russia is very risky and represents a pretty significant escalation by russia eric schmitt absolutely michael any time you have a foreign power much less one like russia targeting american service members — american troops on the ground — that is a very serious thing michael barbaro right because this is in its own way almost a kind of act of war eric schmitt absolutely that’s the way many people would see it just because russia might be using intermediaries or henchmen to do this they’re the ones responsible they’re the ones setting these killings in motion if they’ve happened they’re the ones that are essentially bribing the killers to carry out the attacks and that’s something that’s very very serious and the pentagon and the white house would have to address it music michael barbaro we’ll be right back so eric in your reporting on this russian bounty operation what do you learn about how the white house how the pentagon decides to respond to the conclusion of the intelligence agencies that this operation exists eric schmitt so this assessment that’s been put together by the cia and the military specialoperations forces in afghanistan starts to make its way up the chain of command into washington sometime in late january early february perhaps and it’s very closely held this is some of the most sensitive intelligence in the american government both because of the ramifications if it’s true that russia has put a bounty on american soldiers heads and the political sensitivity that anything to do with russia has with this administration and specifically this white house and that assessment is serious enough that it makes its way into what’s called the presidential daily briefing this is the compendium of top intelligence and news items it’s put together every day for the president to read president trump is not known to read it very often very much he relies more on verbal briefings oral briefings but by february 27 our sources tell us it was in that document about a month later at the end of march the national security council the national security arm of the white house holds its first meeting to discuss the intelligence assessment it’s representatives from the state department from the pentagon from the cia from around the government who can weigh in about the impact this might have and most important the options how should the united states government respond to this and the options that are discussed at this meeting in late march include everything from sending moscow a stern letter — basically cease and desist or else — all the way up to sanctions economic sanctions on top of those already imposed on moscow that have been proven effective in damaging their economy we don’t know if president trump was briefed on any of these options but we do know that his administration did not authorize any kind of action in response nothing has happened so far as a result of this assessment so that’s the way things stood for many weeks that this was very tightly held information at the most senior levels of the government until late last week — archived recording this is sort of stunning here’s the lead eric schmitt — when the times published a major investigation that basically spelled out everything we’ve just been discussing archived recording a new york times report alleges russia offered bounties to the taliban in exchange for killing us forces in afghanistan michael barbaro and what was the immediate reaction to all that information archived recording well look i’m sick to my stomach over this eric schmitt well the immediate reaction was one of stunned disbelief — archived recording sick to my stomach as a member of congress a patriot but also someone who served in afghanistan — archived recording nancy pelosi this is as bad as it gets eric schmitt — both by democrats and republicans in congress archived recording nancy pelosi and yet the president will not confront the russians on this score archived recording republican senator lindsey graham he said quote “imperative congress get to the bottom of recent media reports” archived recording chuck schumer where is president trump his numberone job is to protect american soldiers eric schmitt there was outrage that if indeed this bounty program had existed what was the united states government doing about it how were they protecting their soldiers first of all in afghanistan and what steps were being taken to punish the russians archived recording chuck schumer he should have a plan what are we doing and above all go after putin eric schmitt because this is at a time when president trump has continued to carry out conversations with president putin in fact just a few weeks ago — archived recording donald trump the problem is many of the things that we talk about are about putin eric schmitt — he invited russia to join the g8 conference in washington — archived recording donald trump then i say have him in the room have him in the room eric schmitt — much to the disbelief of european allies and even some of his own republican supporters here in the united states archived recording donald trump so we have a g7 he’s not there half of the meeting is devoted to russia and if he was there it would be much easier to solve eric schmitt so as this information breaks it breaks against a backdrop of the president continuing to enjoy in his view very warm relations with vladimir putin in moscow michael barbaro and how does the white house explain this i mean not only not responding to this russian bounty program but actually growing closer to russia and to vladimir putin after our government had reached this conclusion archived recording kayleigh mcenany hello everyone eric schmitt the white house’s immediate response is — archived recording kayleigh mcenany — the cia director nsa national security adviser and the chief of staff can all confirm that neither the president nor the vice president were briefed on the alleged russian bounty intelligence eric schmitt — that president trump was never briefed on this he never had a briefing from the cia director from his national security adviser from his director of national intelligence and thus how could he have made any decision on it archived recording kayleigh mcenany there is no consensus within the intelligence community on these allegations and in effect there are dissenting opinions from some in the intelligence community with regards to the veracity of what’s being reported eric schmitt the white house press secretary is saying that the reason he wasn’t briefed was because there was no consensus among the intelligence agencies on what to brief him about archived recording adam schiff we need to get to the bottom of these reports i’m going to be briefed at the white house tomorrow i’m asking that my entire committee be briefed by the intel agencies and — eric schmitt democrats and republicans both demand briefings from the president’s top advisers on what the intelligence report says archived recording adam schiff but is this another situation where the president either was told and just rejects it — eric schmitt and what the president knew and when he knew it archived recording adam schiff — or his people are too scared to tell him because it contradicts this narrative of vladimir putin being his buddy eric schmitt what his aides knew and when they knew it and if the president really wasn’t briefed why wasn’t he briefed michael barbaro right because the thinking is that the president knowing and not acting is extremely problematic but the president not knowing is problematic as well because what would it say about an administration if the president was somehow not told this information or did not digest it eric schmitt that’s right there’s no good answer for the white house in this either the president was told and he doesn’t remember he wasn’t told because his aides feared what his reaction might be or he was told and just dismissed it because he didn’t believe the intelligence because it involved negative reporting on russia you have to remember this has happened before you think back to the allegations that russia meddled in the 2016 elections archived recording just now president putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016 eric schmitt and when asked about this at a news conference in helsinki — archived recording would you now with the whole world watching tell president putin would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again eric schmitt president trump turned to president putin archived recording donald trump i have president putin he just said it’s not russia i will say this i don’t see any reason why it would be but i really — eric schmitt he said i believe him over my intelligence agencies this has a different feel to it though so often we’ve seen the past about some of the president’s utterances and judgments and tweets which have kind of fallen into partisan camps and people can say what he really meant or not this is something different this is about soldiers’ lives in afghanistan this is about somebody’s brother somebody’s husband somebody’s daughter who are on the front lines in afghanistan and trump as the commander in chief doesn’t care enough to take the brief doesn’t care enough to read the intelligence about this or his aides don’t think he will something as sacrosanct as the american soldier in harm’s way in the battlefields of afghanistan the white house doesn’t have its back the president doesn’t have their backs that’s something very very troubling indeed if true music michael barbaro thank you eric eric schmitt thank you michael barbaro we’ll be right back here’s what else you need to know today archived recording elizabeth warren dr fauci based on what you’re seeing now how many covid19 deaths and infections should america expect before this is all over archived recording anthony fauci i can’t make an accurate prediction but it is going to be very disturbing i will guarantee you that because when you have an outbreak — michael barbaro during his latest appearance before congress on tuesday dr anthony fauci warned lawmakers that the number of new infections in the us could more than double if current conditions persist archived recording anthony fauci we can’t just focus on those areas that are having the surge it puts the entire country at risk we are now having 40plus thousand new cases a day i would not be surprised if we go up to 100000 a day if this does not turn around and so i am very concerned michael barbaro his warning comes as a surge of infections in the south and west now extend to the midwest where six states are recording higher infection rates overall us infections have increased 80 percent over the past two weeks and in a closely watched senate primary in kentucky amy mcgrath the moderate choice of the democratic party establishment has narrowly defeated charles booker a liberal challenger who harnessed growing public anger over police brutality mcgrath will now face republican senator mitch mcconnell in the fall in its final weeks the kentucky primary had become a referendum on the future of the democratic party and whether the outcry over race and policing could influence the outcome of an election despite losing booker won nearly 43 percent of the vote music

respectively were dedicated in that church my wife’s literacy nonprofit got a strong start at that church i still have friends black and white who attend that church advertisement i say this to say that i know—intimately—the kind of trump supporters the writer of this piece “calling out racist voters is satisfying but it comes at a political cost” is talking about i know them personally as well as professionally given that i was also a leading journalist in that part of south carolina for two decades that’s why even though i sympathize with her point i know it is wrongheaded and futile there is no safe or effective way for a politician to skirt the issue of racism when it comes to white voters who might consider the democratic party if politicians did not point out their racism you can read what briahna gray of the intercept has to say here but here’s a taste of her argument like it or not the opinions of white voters matter and politicians have to balance the validation that marginalized communities deserve against the anxieties of white voters as cheneyrice noted it’s frustrating that white voters’ sensitivity about being called racist often becomes a more central part of the national conversation than the actual consequences of experiencing racism but the consequences of not considering white voters in one’s political messaging strategy are more than just frustrating to millions of black and brown people lgbtq americans women immigrants and differently abled people they are existential in just the last two years voting protections have been bulldozed transgender rights stripped and the deficit exploded on a tax giveaway to the rich — and that’s just the tip of the iceberg if democrats can’t win in 2020 things will only get worse advertisement gray acknowledges the welldocumented racism that’s running rampant among trump supporters including those who may have voted for barack obama once if not twice she is cleareyed that the issue needs to be confronted in no uncertain terms when it comes to racist dog whistles from politicians and the like she even recently chided bernie sanders a man she has defended several times over the past two years for not being straightforward about racism in comments he made shortly after the midterms while discussing the performance of stacey abrams and andrew gillum neither abrams nor gillum shied away from calling out racism though they didn’t win their respective races they had strong showings in really difficult circumstances given that each was trying to do something no one like them had ever done in georgia and florida it’s just that gray also seems convinced that making nonapologetic arguments about that racism—calling it how it is and for what it is—can lead to political defeat for democrats which could mean as we’ve seen the past couple of years the rollback of programs and policies that have helped level the playing field for people of color and others in this country that’s why i’m sympathetic to her concerns because electoral outcomes matter and matter most to the most vulnerable among us we should never forget that even while we remain cleareyed about the democratic party’s many flaws i’m just not convinced that forcing politicians to moderate their frankness about racism will help more democrats win why because i know the kinds of voters gray believes will be moved by such tactics i know they won’t be i spent nearly two decades in that mostly white evangelical church and during much of that time i defended them against charges of blanket racism prayed with them broke bread with them spoke about the complexities of life with them and yet when donald trump showed up in our area for wellattended rallies during the 2016 presidential primaries they flocked to him and his open bigotry nothing i had said over those two decades meant a thing not even the killing of nine black people in a church a couple of counties over convinced them that rejecting the kind of bigotry trump was espousing should be a priority for any rightthinking person—especially people who claimed they wanted equality for families like mine we couldn’t even get a jury to convict a white cop of murdering a black man even though the killing was recorded on clear video—the cop shooting the black man in the back several times as the black man was running away advertisement they did not care all that mattered was that trump was saying things they wanted to hear that’s it and there’s nothing we can do about that does that mean they are irredeemable that they are forever lost to those of us agitating for more justice racial and otherwise no it doesn’t but it definitely means they have to do the kind of soulsearching they have yet to commit to and until that changes nothing—and no one—can convince them to rethink the choices they’ve been making the past few years that’s the cold reality i had to learn the hard way living as a black man in trumpland it would be unwise for democrats to risk alienating their true base —which is the most diverse coalition of voters in us history—by moderating their views on race to appease white voters who will choose to prioritize racial justice when they are good and ready and not a day before—if ever

gsr6w2,2020-05-29 14:25:56,Democrats,Rise in deaths attributed to pneumonia suggests official US coronavirus death toll is grossly undercounted,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/05/29/death-m29.html,Lost_Tourist_61,1138,35,data collected by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc suggests that tens of thousands of deaths attributed to pneumonia were more likely caused by the coronavirus pandemic and that the real death toll from covid19 is nearly 50 percent higher than the officially reported number of about 103000 according to provisional data from the cdc’s national center for health statistics nchs there were at least 63752 deaths caused by the pandemic from the week ending april 4 through the week ending may 2 reflecting the sharp rise in cases in the united states beginning in midmarch during that same period there were 47812 pneumonia deaths which is 65 percent higher than normal based on seasonal averages assuming that these excess deaths were actually caused by the pandemic either directly by the virus or by those who fell sick and were afraid to get treated at a hospital this would bring the covidrelated mortality in april to 92524 extrapolating through may this would bring the actual number of dead as a result of the coronavirus to just under 150000 a person is taken on a stretcher into the united memorial medical center in houston texas after going through testing for covid19 ap photodavid j phillip and even these numbers are likely an underestimate the cdc itself notes that mortality reporting is often behind by two months connecticut has not submitted its tally for pneumonia and influenza deaths since april 25 and north carolina has not submitted such data since april 18 the most recent data collected from the week ending on may 16 is at most 306 percent complete the likely higher numbers are corroborated by data from the website statistacom which shows that from february to may 16 the number of covid19 deaths was 73639 and that the number of pneumonia deaths was 89555 subtracting the seasonal average for pneumonia leaves 32555 fatalities unaccounted for assuming again that these excess deaths were all caused by the pandemic this brings the covid19 total during that period up to 106194 an increase of 44 percent a review of this data also makes clear that the deadliness of the coronavirus dwarfs that of influenza the data from statista shows 6253 deaths from the flu barely eight percent of the deaths from covid19 and even those the site notes also include “deaths with pneumonia or covid19 also listed as a cause of death” the unexplained sharp increase in pneumonia deaths is notable in many of the states that rushed to reopen as early as possible in colorado which let its stayathome order expire on april 26 there are 919 coronavirus deaths recorded for april in the cdc’s provisional database and 762 fatalities from pneumonia more than three times the seasonal average if the excess deaths are counted as covid19 the state’s coronavirus mortality rate jumps by nearly 60 percent similarly for mississippi which loosened restrictions starting april 27 the real mortality rate is likely at least 49 percent higher the undercounting of covid19 deaths is being obfuscated by the cdc there is a notable discrepancy between the pneumonia death count cited by the cdc and that cited by its nchs unit which is three times as high the wsws contacted the cdc to inquire about this discrepancy the nurse responding on the phone admitted she was new and was unable to render much assistance though she did agree there was a discrepancy the call was then transferred to a manager who was also not able to explain the data the call was transferred to the nchs then further transferred to the office of the director and a message was left on their answering machine requesting a callback no callback came even the 150000 deaths calculated here could well be an undercount pneumonia may not be the only cause of death concealing the lethality of covid19 which is not just a respiratory disease but attacks the lungs heart liver and brain while the cdc does not have national data on heart disease for this year state public health offices have published data which suggest that some cases of heart disease are ultimately derived from the pandemic in michigan for example deaths from heart disease were up 20 percent in april from the total the previous year strokes another potentially fatal symptom of the coronavirus were up 18 percent from the previous year these issues are going to become more pronounced as the white house and state governors press for an even more rapid return to work from the beginning the chief concern of president donald trump and his cohorts in washington has been to not spook the markets the dangers of the pandemic have been downplayed since january with trump refusing to implement mass testing until well after the disease had achieved a beachhead in new york city and other areas of the country at the same time the actual collection and reporting of the data itself has been muddled and suppressed last week the employee in charge of florida’s coronavirus database was fired after refusing to manipulate the data to justify governor ron desantis’ backtowork order an incident which has gone largely unreported in the national news the cdc itself has come under fire for conflating nasal swab tests for the virus and antibody tests as both confirming the presence of coronavirus in a person when the agency itself knows that these tests measure two different things and that the latter test gives inaccurate results about half the time these are not coincidences while no doubt some deaths caused by the coronavirus were mistakenly labeled as pneumonia or some other disease by an overworked coroner or medical examiner workers should be suspicious that there is a concerted effort by the entire political establishment to manipulate data on the pandemic in order to facilitate its campaign to force the reopening of factories offices and plants while thousands are still dying of the coronavirus

transformation began during the reagan administration that was when supplyside economics what bush called “voodoo economics” and unremitting hostility toward government “the problem” ronald reagan called it “not the solution to our problem” became the regnant party orthodoxy eschewing the staid greeneyeshade accounting of republicans past the supplysiders argued that cuts in marginal income tax rates could pay for themselves it did not of course happen the reagan tax cuts which slashed the top rate from 70 percent to 28 percent caused the deficit to nearly double from 79 billion in 1981 to 153 billion in 1989 the fiscal situation would have been even worse if reagan who was far more responsible than his most fervent followers had not signed tax increases in 1982 1983 and 1984 that clawed back about half of the 1981 tax cut the deficit spending of the reagan years was at least justified because it boosted the economy out of a deep recession and helped the armed forces recover from their postvietnam nadir but the political success of reagan’s tax cuts has mesmerized republicans ever since leading them to advocate steep tax cuts regardless of the circumstances ad ad in 2017 the republican congress passed and trump signed a massive tax cut that delivered a sugar high to the economy that is already wearing off 2018 was the worst year for the stock market in a decade while bequeathing debt that could take generations to pay off as bloomberg news notes “total public debt outstanding has jumped by 19 trillion since president donald trump took office” or “roughly the size of brazil’s gross domestic product” the gop’s proclivity for using government shutdowns to force through its agenda is another example of its drunken fratboy antics the three longest government shutdowns in us history were all caused by republican temper tantrums in 19951996 republicans led by house speaker newt gingrich ga shut down the government for 21 days to force president bill clinton who was committed to a balanced budget to accept steeper cuts in domestic spending than he wanted that was a publicrelations debacle that contributed to gingrich’s downfall in 2013 sen ted cruz rtex and his tea party allies forced a 17day shutdown in a futile attempt to defund the affordable care act in both cases republicans were willing to halt the vital operations of the government and risk the creditworthiness of the united states to try to shove their ideological demands down the throat of a president who disagreed with them ad ad the current partial shutdown — the longest on record at more than three weeks and counting — is even more reckless and illadvised having begun on dec 22 when republicans still controlled both ends of pennsylvania avenue the “border emergency” used to justify the funding stoppage is a figment of the xenophobic imaginations of ann coulter rush limbaugh and donald trump the number of apprehensions at the southern border declined 75 percent in the past two decades — from 16 million in 2000 to 397000 last year the number of undocumented immigrants in the united states is at a 15year low immigrants both legal and illegal commit fewer crimes than the nativeborn and there has never been a terrorist attack in the united states carried out by terrorists who entered the united states from mexico there is to be sure a longstanding problem with undocumented immigrants and drugs entering the united states but spending as trump proposes 57 billion to build an extra 200 miles of wall along a 2000mile border will not solve anything most drugs and roughly half of all undocumented immigrants arrive through legal ports of entry trump has conjured an illusory solution to an imaginary crisis but having taken the country hostage he and his republican allies are inflicting real suffering on 800000 federal workers and real danger on 325 million americans fbi agents transportation security administration officers air traffic controllers and coast guard members are working without pay — or as with a growing number of airport screeners not working morale is plunging and financial worries rising among the men and women charged with keeping us safe ad ad a party that felt an iota of responsibility to the country would be alarmed by these developments and would reopen the government even if it meant overriding the president’s veto but for the drunken fratboy party the damage inflicted by its ideological bender is no reason to sober up indeed for the most antigovernment republicans the shutdown is a feature not a bug because it is shrinking at least for a few weeks the size of the government the republicans of yesteryear would send today’s republicans to their rooms without any supper

schools",https://progressiveseverywhere.org/2018/04/16/oklahoma-teachers-are-running-for-office-as-democrats-fighting-for-children-vs-the-1/,JournalistDude,1136,73,when cyndi ralston retired after more than three decades as a public school teacher she could have never imagined that just a few years later she would be at the center of national headlines and the public figurehead of a major political rebellion and yet there she was driving across the state of oklahoma this past tuesday giving interviews and plotting out her nascent campaign for state legislature fitting in strategy and press in the few hours she wasn’t marching on the state capitol with her many fellow striking teachers after returning to the classroom to help combat oklahoma’s desperate teacher shortage in 2017 ralston decided that she also had to help fix the cause of the state’s awful education woes so on friday she filed to run to represent oklahoma’s 12th house district officially commencing a race that has already earned national press coverage as a symbol of the political struggle in roiling red states it is a microcosm of 2018 ralston is running against a republican state representative named kevin mcdugle who drew outrage with a vicious antiteacher facebook rant ralston had been planning to run for months and was carefully preparing her campaign when that rant went viral springing her into action ahead of schedule “he just was going off on how the students were watching us and we were being a bad example and yada yada yada” ralston recalls still annoyed by mcdugle’s diatribe “and i was like you’re right sir they are watching us and we’re teaching them what freedom looks like that we can petition our government that we have the right to be here and peacefully protest” ralston is one of many oklahoman teachers who has decided to step up and run for office as a democrat as the teacher’s strike becomes even more political they’re campaigning explicitly against the trickledown economics of that have bankrupted the state government and fighting to increase the paltry education budget that the legislature just passed ralston who has become a figurehead for the movement spoke to progressives everywhere twice this week with a followup conversation focused on the teacher union’s internal disagreement over a recent call to end the strike click here to donate to oklahoma teachers via progressives everywhere’s actblue page for oklahoma teachers you returned to the classroom because oklahoma passed a law allowing retired teachers to come back and keep their retirement but the teacher shortage has had other consequences right maybe halfway through my career they started allowing “alternatively certified” teachers the difference in that is that alternatively certified teacher has to have a degree and they have to complete courses like child development and classroom management now they have “emergency certified teachers” and they don’t have to have any training whatsoever they have to have a degree but no training and education so they’re throwing his people bless them into the classroom with no child development no training on classroom management no training on how to effectively teach i commend the people for trying to step into gaps that have been created because of the lack of funding for schools for the past 10 years but that’s not fair to them or the kids we have several classrooms in oklahoma that are still not filled with anyone at all and they’ve been served by substitutes all year long just different people in and out always a different person in the room so nobody’s making plans there’s no continuity for the kids how did this happen in 2004 they cut income tax they lowered the top income tax level down to where a lot of oklahomans are paying the same tax rate of 5 it’s kind of absurd that russell westbrook as much as we love him is paying the same tax rate as i am they also lowered the gross production tax on oil companies from 7 to 2 percent on the first three years of a new well and they never raised it back with when the 2008 recession hit they said if we give the businesses a break and we give corporations a break that’s going to trickle down and more jobs and blah blah blah well it didn’t work it ended up costing major amounts of revenue and then now that the economy’s turned back around they haven’t changed anything they passed an education funding bill and raised teacher salaries right before the deadline but it fell short which led to the strike right so they passed the bill that raises teacher salaries but what we had asked for was 200 million to be put in general education that just brings us back up to the 2008 level of funding they play games play games and then they did pass it — but they gave us 50 million for the general fund the raise was nice and we thank them for it after 10 years without a raise but we cared about the funding and we asked for 200 million because we have not had new textbooks in 10 years they had allowed them to open the textbook fund which has never happened before and opened it up to allow them to use it for general funds to pay for teachers we have ripped apart ducttaped books and we only have 25 reading books per grade level at my school the teachers have done an amazing job being creative we have the kids have rotate from teacher to teacher one teacher teaches all reading because we only have 25 books one teacher teaches language and spelling one teacher teaches math that starts at first grade and developmentally children should not be going to three different classrooms during the day high school kids struggle with that we’re having six and sevenyearolds do it over 70 of oklahomans approve of the strike which is incredible people are figuring it out from listening to us they’re also watching the process which they haven’t done before and they’re tired of it they want the money in education that’s it they understand that that’s one of the most important things for future and their own children and grandchildren it’s been amazing to see the kids up there and learning and watching and being in the gallery and going and talking to legislators and realizing these are people they’re not any different than you they’re elected to represent you and you can go and speak to them about what you feel and what you would like them to do it’s been amazing and yet mcdugle didn’t think that we’re doing such a great job leading and teaching our students the head of the oklahoma education association has called for an end to the strike where do you stand on that teachers were very frustrated when oea had a media event on thursday evening saying that the walkout was over they felt like the oea wasn’t speaking for the collective group a lot of teachers want to drop their memberships but i’ve asked them not to do that and to actually join the oea but call for the resignation of the president of the association if we lose membership we will lose our bargaining power that is extremely important to keep in a right to work state we are continuing our pressure on the republican legislators that have not allowed the bill that repeals the capital gains tax exemption and another amendment to a bill that just got written friday by republican leadership that allows the legislature to pull from already appropriated funds like teacher retirement if the revenue brought in that year won’t fully fund their budget for the year there have been several years recently that due to tax cuts and restructuring of our tax codes on top of not having oil and gas companies pay their fair share that this very thing has happened this will only compound the problems we are having in our state not solve them we are still holding them accountable by sending delegations of teachers from every school district that we can to the capitol with parents and community leaders every day until the end of the session we are watching the live feeds of committees and checking votes every day then calling them about their votes immediately ralston’s son josh martin is also running for office in ok’s 80th house district with so many great candidates

Vote,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/a-federal-court-just-ruled-that-thousands-of-eligible-voters-in-georgia-must-be-allowed-to-vote-brian-kemp-stacey-abrams/,madam1,1123,35,let our journalists help you make sense of the noise subscribe to the mother jones daily newsletter and get a recap of news that matters thousands of eligible voters in georgia who were blocked from registering to vote must be allowed to cast a ballot in the 2018 midterm election next week a federal court ruled on friday the decision could have a big impact on the incredibly tight race for governor that has been marred by republican voter suppression efforts more than 50000 voters in the state have had their voter registration applications put on hold by georgia secretary of state brian kemp who is running for governor against democrat stacey abrams because information on their registration forms didn’t exactly match state databases this court case deals specifically with more than 3000 of those voters who were flagged as “noncitizens” because their citizenship status hadn’t been updated in state databases when they became us citizens district court judge eleanor ross an appointee of barack obama ruled that there was “a very substantial risk of disenfranchisement” for those voters wrongly flagged as noncitizens and that they must be able to cast a ballot in 2018 in georgia legal permanent residents are able to obtain a driver’s license but when they become us citizens their citizenship information is not automatically updated in state databases so when they go to register to vote these naturalized citizens are sometimes wrongly flagged as noncitizens these eligible voters are supposed to be given a ballot if they show up at the polls with proof of us citizenship but that policy hasn’t been fairly enforced in georgia the court found following a legal challenge against kemp filed by voting rights groups including the lawyers committee for civil rights and campaign legal center on october 19 in her ruling judge ross cited the example of an israeliborn voter named yotam oren who became a naturalized us citizen last year but was turned away from the polls earlier this month prior to voting early in the november 6 2018 election mr oren checked defendant kemp’s secretary of state website which informed mr oren that he could vote if he brought proof of citizenship to the polling station on october 16 2018 mr oren went to his designated earlyvoting polling location in fulton county he checked in with a poll worker and showed her his valid united states passport as proof of citizenship the poll worker directed mr oren to another election official who informed mr oren that she would need to call yet another person to change his status from “pending” to “active” so that he could vote while mr oren waited the official was unable to reach the intended person on the phone and informed mr oren that he could continue to wait or come back another time to vote no one offered mr oren an option to cast a provisional ballot mr oren did not want to wait any longer and left “this entire experience was unnecessarily timeconsuming confusing and frustrating” oren told the atlanta journal constitution “i imagine that many ‘pending’ voters would give up and not vote when faced with the same barrier i encountered when i tried to vote the first time as a united states citizen” the judge ordered that poll managers in georgia must give naturalized citizens a regular ballot if they bring proof of citizenship with them to the polls this will particularly benefit minority voters who were far more likely than whites to be wrongly flagged as noncitizens as the court wrote “asian applicants constitute 270 percent of those flagged as noncitizens even though they comprise only 21 percent of georgia’s registered voter pool latino applicants constitute 170 percent of those flagged as noncitizens even though they comprise 28 percent of georgia’s registered voter pool and white applicants constitute only 137 percent of those flagged as noncitizens even though they comprise 540 percent of georgia’s registered voter pool” the ruling could provide a major boost to abrams who is garnering strong support from minority voters in her bid to become the first black woman governor in us history other eligible voters who have been put on the state’s pending registration list for reasons other than citizenship can vote inperson tuesday if they bring a valid photo id with them even still voting rights advocates are worried that those who receive a letter informing them that there is a problem with their registration may be discouraged from showing up to vote or that their ballots will be improperly rejected by election officials the order friday is the second time in recent weeks that a federal court has ruled against kemp’s efforts to make it more difficult to vote on october 24 the court ruled that georgia counties could not throw out absentee ballots because the signature on the ballot didn’t match the voter registration form “the court does not understand how assuring that all eligible voters are permitted to vote undermines integrity of the election process” wrote judge leigh martin may who serves alongside ross

gv8pe0,2020-06-02 17:51:43,Democrats,Biden slams Trump’s response to George Floyd protests: ‘More interested in power than principle’,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/02/george-floyd-protests-biden-slams-trump-over-st-johns-church-photo-op.html,progress18,1106,46,washington — former vice president joe biden addressed the ongoing civil unrest across the nation tuesday calling it a wakeup call for america biden slammed president donald trumps handling of the multiple crises plaguing the country including the protests against police brutality and the coronavirus biden also laid out his own plan for police reform and he pressed congress to pass legislation that would prohibit the use of chokeholds by police the solemn rousing speech in philadelphia ranged from sweeping references to historical injustice and broadsides against trump to the personal story of his son beau bidens death it was bidens first formal address in public since march when the coronavirus forced him and millions of other americans to shelter in place look the presidency is a big job nobody will get everything right and i wont either but i promise you this i wont traffic in fear and division biden said i wont fan the flames of hate i will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country – not use them for political gain the eight days of unrest were sparked by the killing of george floyd 46 an unarmed black man in police custody in minneapolis floyd died after a minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes the officer was charged with thirddegree murder and an independent autopsy found that asphyxiation was the cause of floyds death the ensuing demonstrations some of which turned violent have prompted trump to called for governors to use harsher tactics and greater force when confronting protesters biden invoked floyds memory on tuesday by repeating his last words i cant breathe george floyds last words said biden but they didnt die with him theyre still being heard theyre echoing across this nation they speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk they speak to a nation where more than 100000 people have lost their lives to a virus and 40 million americans have filed for unemployment – with a disproportionate number of these deaths and job losses concentrated in the black and minority communities he added over the past 24 hours the splitscreen image that has been created by the two major party nominees for the white house in november biden and trump is as stark as any from a presidential race in recent memory on monday trump threatened to deploy activeduty us military if states failed to quell the demonstrations in response response to floyds death as the president spoke riot police and military police outside the white house used tear gas to clear protesters out of lafayette square a public park in front of the presidents residence once the protesters were forcibly cleared trump walked through the square and stood in front of st johns church which had been set on fire by protesters the night before the president stood in front of the church holding a bible and then later motioned for members of his cabinet to stand alongside him for a photograph biden addressed the move on tuesday saying trump is more interested in power than in principle when peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the peoples house the white house — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle biden said the former vice president drew a sharp contrast on tuesday between trumps leadership style and his own ill do my job and take responsibility i wont blame others ill never forget that the job isnt about me its about you said biden and ill work to not only rebuild this nation but to build it better than it was a white house spokesman declined to comment on bidens remarks the trump campaign accused biden of using the politics of racial division while defending the presidents response to the protest president trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity said campaign advisor katrina pierson as coronavirus lockdowns across the country are lifted the 2020 presidential campaign is poised to enter a new phase more closely resembling a traditional campaign with both candidates giving speeches and personally appealing to voters as of tuesday biden held a 6point lead over trump in the real clear politics average of national presidential polls trump is the underdog in his reelection race having trailed biden in every major national poll since early february biden who was vice president under barack obama the first black us president has previously said that he decided to run for the white house after hearing trump say there were very fine people on both sides of the violence in charlottesville virginia where white supremacists and neonazis marched in 2017 on tuesday biden placed trumps leadership squarely in the category of enemies confronting the united states
gaiy8w,2020-04-30 01:10:12,Democrats,GOP admits privately that Georgia is in play and that Trump and other Republicans may lose there,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/politics/david-perdue-georgia-senate/index.html,wenchette,1112,23,cnn sen david perdue a georgia republican up for reelection and a close trump confidant issued a blunt warning to gop activists during an offtherecord conference call this week democrats are in position to turn his state blue and take the senate heres the reality the state of georgia is in play perdue said monday according to an audio recording of a call with women for trump obtained by cnn the democrats have made it that way the stark warning from a gop senator who is not considered among the most vulnerable republicans this election cycle illustrates the fear among republicans that democrats chances of taking back the senate continue to grow already facing the prospect of defending the senate with an unpopular republican president in an election cycle with more seats to defend than to target republicans are up against a bevy of wellfunded democratic challengers and are now navigating a public health and economic crisis that has injected deep uncertainty into the national political landscape indeed the political environment for gop senators has only become more challenging in the past few months republican incumbents in colorado arizona maine and north carolina always knew they would face a tough path to reelection now republicans in more conservative states georgia iowa montana and even kansas have realized the same republicans are particularly concerned that the intraparty battles in kansas and georgia two states trump carried in 2016 could make it easier for democrats to gain the three seats they need to take back the senate if former vice president joe biden wins the presidency since the vice president breaks a 5050 tie behind the scenes gop senators are trying to instill fear into their base and mobilize their loyal voters into action republican sources say on the private monday call perdue told the gop activists that the 2020 elections would be a turning point for america our wakeup call in georgia the georgia senator laid out an apocalyptic view in the eyes of republicans if democrats take back the senate warning they would seek to make washington dc and puerto rico states try to abolish the electoral college add four justices to the supreme court and create a singleparty system we have had our wakeup call in georgia perdue said detailing the states recent electoral history of increasingly tight races perdue said he needs to win twice the number of votes than he did in his 2014 campaign to keep his seat due to the influx of new democrats in georgia the demographic moves against us but we can still win this if we get out and make sure that all of our voters vote thats what this comes down to ginger howard a georgia committeewoman for the republican party responded that perdues analysis was very sobering its hard to hear she said on the call the truth hurts sometimes and we need to know that because weve got to work doubly hard asked for comment about the call perdue spokeswoman casey black said from day one our campaign has known that this will be a competitive race with his strong record of proven results in the us senate we are confident that georgia voters will reelect david perdue this november howard didnt respond to an inquiry seeking comment perdues assessment is striking in part because both parties view his race as less competitive than the other senate race in georgia a special election to fill the seat of the retired sen johnny isakson in that race candidates of all parties will be on the ballot in november and whoever takes a majority of the vote will win the seat outright otherwise there will be a runoff between the top two candidates with loeffler and collins engaged in a ferocious and personal fight republican leaders are worried that it will only boost the chances of reverend raphael warnock the senior pastor of the ebenezer baptist church in atlanta and a democrat who raised 15 million in the first quarter the rev raphael g warnock speaks during the martin luther king jr annual commemorative service in january at ebenezer baptist church in atlanta in a recent interview warnock attacked loeffler who has faced questions over stock trades in her portfolio made before the market took a nosedive the subject of a new procollins super pac ad right now georgia has a senator who when she received the news about the coronavirus pandemic seemed to be more focused on sheltering her own investments than she was in making sure that those who were sheltering in have the protections that they need said warnock stephen lawson a spokesman for loeffler disputed warnocks allegation saying she has put people not politics first during the coronavirus crisis while mr warnock is parroting baseless accusations from the radical left sen loeffler is working around the clock to deliver relief to georgians impacted by covid19 lawson said presidential influence republicans in washington are worried that their incumbent senators are not getting the recognition they deserve for backing emergency rescue legislation to prop up the faltering economy including hundreds of billions of dollars for small businesses hospitals workers and the unemployed instead their governors are generally receiving the lions share of the credit for implementing the states response whats more republicans need trump to steady his handling of the pandemic given that many of their electoral prospects will depend on his performance at the polls whit ayres a prominent gop pollster said it will be a challenge for republican senators to run very far ahead of the president given the deeply polarized electorate that means the presidents standing in each of these states is every bit as important or more important than the senators standing ayres said on the private call perdue made clear his affinity for trump and gushed about the presidents handling of the crisis i really think that president trump is a person of destiny perdue said when asked how trumps response to the pandemic helped save lives several democrats including former congressional candidate jon ossoff 2018 lieutenant governor nominee sarah riggs amico and former columbus mayor teresa tomlinson are vying for the chance to take on perdue but the republican senator boasts a huge fundraising advantage with over 9 million on hand and an easier path to reelection than at least seven other gop incumbents according to political handicappers looking at kansas and the rest of the country but the challenges for republicans extend well outside of that race in the first quarter of the year republicans in seven other senate races in arizona maine north carolina colorado kansas georgia and montana were outraised by democratic challengers in kansas a state which has not elected a democrat to the senate since 1932 democratic state sen barbara bollier raised nearly 24 million much more than any of her potential republican challengers in the first quarter of the year the race has become one of the biggest headaches for republicans in large part because of the divisive primary state gop chair mike kuckelman has urged two candidates to drop out of the race which could give rep roger marshall a better chance to defeat kobach and plumbingbusiness owner bob hamilton whose late entrance has upended the race as weve said for months this is a twoman race said eric pahls marshalls campaign manager the last thing kobach wants is a oneonone race with dr marshall while we cant control what others do we can keep working harder than anyone and focusing on what has worked for us talking with kansans about what matters to them danedri herbert kobachs spokeswoman said that hamiltons entry into the race probably helps their campaign now moderate republicans have two people to choose from hamilton and roger marshall she said a person with knowledge of hamiltons plans said that kobachs failure to win in the governors race in 2018 coupled with conservatives who are actively fighting marshalls candidacy gives the businessman the best chance to win hamilton has the resources to partially fund his own campaign our candidacy puts a lot of fears to rest if hes the nominee the source said president donald trump waves after speaking alongside thenkansas secretary of state kris kobach in the eisenhower executive office building next to the white house in july 2017 republican leaders in washington dont want to spend money in kansas but fear they may have to if the race appears to be slipping away on tuesday the democratic senatorial campaign committee announced it would reserve more than 30 million in fall advertising for four states trump won in 2016 arizona north carolina iowa and montana republicans have two offensive opportunities in deep red alabama and michigan where sen gary peters was outraised by challenger john james last quarter but the money race so far has benefited the democrats and even in those where it hasnt like in iowa a state trump won by over nine points in 2016 outside groups have made sure to keep it competitive two rival super pacs the senate leadership fund and senate majority pac have announced theyd set aside over 25 million dollars to advertise this fall in iowa the national republican senatorial committee has realized the threat of losing the senate reserving ads starting in june earlier than the past cycle with at least 31 million reserved for the cycle in seven states an amount that is certain to grow the senate leadership fund which is aligned with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has already reserved 67 million in six key states more than double its initial amount in 2018 it already has spent roughly 2 million against collins in georgia senate majority pac which is aligned with senate democratic leader chuck schumer has likewise reserved over 69 million in fall advertising time we do have a competitive situation in the senate mcconnell said on wednesday noting on fox news radio that 23 republican and only a dozen democrats are up for reelection so yes were on defense—and weve got competitive races all over the place

gdyv2f,2020-05-05 17:36:12,Democrats,Democrat Steve Bullock leads GOP Daines in Montana's Senate contest 46-39,https://www.ktvh.com/news/montana-news/msu-poll-bullock-leads-daines-in-senate-contest,wenchette,1112,23,helena — a new poll from montana state university shows democratic gov steve bullock leading republican sen steve daines by seven percentage points in montana’s highprofile 2020 us senate contest the online poll which surveyed 738 montanans in midtolate april asked registered likely voters who they would support if the election for senate were held now just over 46 percent said they’d choose bullock and 39 percent supported daines seven percent said they were undecided while another 6 percent said they would vote for someone else a libertarian and green party candidate also are on the ballot gov steve bullock dmontana david parker the chair of the political science department at msubozeman said the poll confirms that the bullockdaines contest will be a close hardfought race – one of the mostwatched senate matchups in the nation “i think it’s certainly reasonable to assume that the race is probably within the margin of error and too close to call” he told mtn news “so while we show a lead for bullock it’s within the margin of error so i would say yeah this is a competitive senate race” the poll’s margin of error is plusorminus 46 percentage points the poll also asked voters about the presidential race in montana and their approval of how top officials have responded to the covid19 pandemic president trump led democrat joe biden but only by 56 percentage points – 453 percent to 397 percent about 10 percent said they would vote for someone else and 5 percent said they were undecided fiftythree percent of montanans approve of the president’s response to the coronavirus outbreak while 39 percent disapprove and 8 percent don’t know bullock however had 70 percent of montanans approving of his response to the pandemic and just 20 percent who said they disapproved us sen steve daines rmont only 48 percent of those surveyed said they approved of daines’ response but 28 percent said they didn’t know the numbers were similar for democratic us sen jon tester 42 percent said they approved and 30 percent said they didn’t know parker said he’s not surprised by bullock’s high approval rating and the middling rating of montana’s us senators “it just demonstrates the information advantage that executives have in these times of crisis” he said parker said he analyzed the montana media exposure of bullock and daines during the month of march and found about 800 news articles mentioning the governor and only 150 mentioning daines “so we have an information advantage people like the job that bullock is doing and he was already popular” he said “then let’s add the final piece of the equation steve daines has been on tv since early march with television advertising do you know how much steve bullock has spent on tv zero so that certainly should be a cause for concern by daines” a closer look at the bullockdaines numbers also revealed details about each man’s strengths and weaknesses among demographic groups of voters bullock has a huge lead among women 52 percent to 29 percent and led among all age groups except those 70 and older and those aged 3039 – the latter of which he trailed by only a point he also leads among selfdeclared independents which are almost onethird of the respondents by 4632 and strongly among those with college degrees daines leads among men 53 percent to 40 percent among those with a highschool diploma or less and among two income groups those earning 30000 to 50000 a year by six percentage points and those earning more than 150000 a year by 24 percentage points among democrats who made up just less than a fourth of respondents 87 percent said they would vote for bullock daines had the support of 82 percent of republicans who were onethird of the respondents to the poll daines elected in 2014 is trying to win a second consecutive term bullock a twoterm governor had said for more than a year that he wasn’t interested in challenging daines in 2020 and ran for president for several months in 2019 but on march 9 the last day to file as a candidate in montana for 2020 bullock got into the race instantly catapulting the contest to a nationallevel matchup he raised 33 million in campaign funds in the first three weeks as a candidate parker said the covid19 pandemic also has scrambled the race in ways that will be difficult to predict in addition to bullock getting huge free media exposure for leading the state during the pandemic it may be difficult to bombard him with negative ads in this time of crisis he said “right now it’s going to be really hard to attack somebody who is just trying to steer the state through a serious crisis and who the public thinks is doing a pretty good job” parker said the electorate also is viewing issues in a much different way and candidates aren’t yet able to campaign in traditional ways such as holding rallies or meeting voters oneonone he added “it’s hard given all of that uncertainty to even project what’s going to happen in the fall” parker said “it’s always hard it’s even harder now”

9zawiu,2018-11-22 06:47:58,Democrats,"No, Trump isn’t putting ‘America first.’ He’s putting himself first.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/11/21/no-trump-isnt-putting-america-first-hes-putting-himself-first/,therecordcorrected,1104,58,it’s a subtle error but a serious one in the media discussion of trump’s response to the murder you often see variations of the claim that trump has revealed an unpleasant unstated truth about his worldview — that trump will put america first even if it requires sanctioning the most reprehensible conduct or doing things that are necessary even if people find them deeply unsettling ad the lead story on trump’s response in the new york times for instance describes it as “a stark distillation of the trump worldview” which is “heedless of the facts” correct but also “remorselessly transactional” and “determined to put america’s interests first” a post piece claims trump is prioritizing america’s “bottom line” a cnn analysis notes that “america first” means trump will look the other way “as long as a foreign power enriches the united states” adding “perhaps trump should get marks for frankness” ad the suggestion here is that we are now seeing what “america first” really looks like that is when trump says “america first” he means it but this concedes too much in an inadvertent but pernicious way it supports trump’s preferred framing of his presidency in this case and many others trump is not being “frank” about his real priorities and he is not putting america first he’s putting his own naked selfinterest over what’s good for america and prioritizing the realworld policy realization of his own prejudices and hatreds over any goodfaith factbased effort to determine by any discernible standard what might actually be in the country’s interests trump’s idea of a ‘dangerous’ world ad trump’s core claim that we must overlook the killing to maintain our current relationship with the saudis and that this is good for us is itself mostly nonsense as a post editorial points out the failure to sanction those responsible for the murder — including the saudi kingdom per the conclusion of the cia — buttresses a world in which “dictators know they can murder their critics and suffer no consequences” ad trump’s response to this notion is the idea that “the world is a very dangerous place” and that he will pursue our “national interests” in this dangerous world but trump’s statement on the killing relies on falsehoods to depict maintaining our relationship with the saudis as in our “national interests” as we’ve noted the saudis did not agree to spend and invest 450 billion in the united states a number trump seems to have just made up they did not order 110 billion in military equipment and they will not be creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the united states but i’d like to take this further and point out that here trump is not actually operating from any meaningful conception of what is good for the country it isn’t just those lies it’s also trump’s insistence that we’ll never know whether the crown prince actually ordered the killing which breaks from the intelligence community’s conclusion and the subtle slandering of khashoggi via the floating of the saudi claim that he was an “enemy of the state” ad i challenge you to read those things as driven by any conception of what’s good for america they are arguably damaging to the country since they weaken faith in efforts to determine the truth and could further distress americans who are deeply upset by the murder but what’s undoubtedly true is that they can only be about making trump’s current stance politically easier for himself ad the bigger idea at stake here in trump’s response is the notion that our commitment to international standards of human rights are to be jettisoned when they get in the way of our “interests” it’s true that the united states has a long history of turning a blind eye to saudi human rights abuses but this does not preclude responding to this particular atrocity and merely claiming trump is revealing “the truth” about our previous realpolitik does not justify the current absence of any response more to the point trump is not merely acquiescing to this unfortunate “truth” he’s actively weakening our commitment to human and civil rights on many other fronts as well both at home and abroad ad the idea that adherence to international standards on human rights — but also international commitments on other matters such as fighting climate change and taking in asylum seekers and refugees — is a zerosum negative for america is of course supposed to be foundational to trump’s worldview but the administration has never actually defended this proposition on any of these fronts in a factbased manner ad lies lies and more lies this is most glaringly true on asylum seekers and refugees limiting their entry is also foundational to “america first” trumpism but trump has not merely tried to reduce asylum seeking he has justified this with all manner of lies about the supposed threat it poses to us trump has not just slashed refugee levels to historic lows and employed bureaucratic chicanery to reduce those levels further his administration deepsixed internal data showing them to be a net economic positive ad the point here again is that trump is placing his prejudices — his determination to implement a white nationalist agenda — over any goodfaith effort to determine what the actual impact of this agenda will be on the country on the migrants the selfinterest runs even deeper than this the lies about the “caravan” were all about keeping the house in gop hands — he even used the military as a prop in this exercise — to prevent democrats from taking the house and subjecting him to accountability ad other aspects of trump’s white nationalism underscore the point trump’s “many sides” comment after charlottesville which emboldened white nationalists rather than calming racial tensions his pardoning of racist joe arpaio his attacks on african american athletes — trump reportedly believed these things would help him politically never mind that they stoked civil conflict that harmed the country over and over trump’s prejudice and naked selfinterest trump as it were any conception of the national interest need more the new york times reports that trump privately wanted to order the justice department to prosecute hillary clinton and james comey there is no possible way this is based on any conception of the national good unless trump is totally delusional which would itself mean there’s no such operative

president donald trumps authoritarian slide experts warned there need to be mass protests a yale philosophy professor and expert on fascism told insider the republican party is betraying democracy and these are historical times someone has got to push back since he was acquitted in the gopcontrolled senate earlier this month the president has overseen a white house purge of impeachment witnesses and the attorney general has intervened in the trial of a trump associate republicans have mostly sat back with at least one senator conceding that trumps behavior did not seem to have changed because of impeachment there is absolutely no reason for him to stop pushing it goes against both his personality and his experience cas mudde a political scientist at the university of georgia told insider visit insiders homepage for more stories if americans are concerned that president donald trump and republicans are moving the us toward becoming a oneparty authoritarian state they are running out of time to stop them experts warned trump has exhibited autocratic impulses since his 2016 campaign and from the moment he entered the white house the president has attacked virtually every democratic institution in the us when hes felt its actions were unfavorable to his agenda or public appearance meanwhile he pushed traditional us allies away while openly embracing many of the worlds most repressive leaders these trends have raised concern among top experts on authoritarianism fascism and democracy but theyve often said that the robust political system in the us with its checks and balances and constitutional norms has prevented trump from becoming a fullblown authoritarian and doing whatever he wants since trump was acquitted in the senate earlier this month after being impeached in the house over his dealings with ukraine theres been a white house purge of impeachment witnesses and attorney general william barr has intervened in the trial of a close associate of the president roger stone and the experts tone has changed dramatically someone has got to push back the system is enabling trump jason stanley a yale philosophy professor who wrote how fascism works told insider there need to be mass protests he said the republican party is betraying democracy and these are historical times someone has got to push back the deeply worrying moment is when you start to become a oneparty state stanley added the republican party has shown that it has no interest in multiparty democracy they are much more concerned with power with consolidating power stanley said recent actions by republicans and trump were straight from the literature on authoritarianism only one republican sen mitt romney of utah voted to convict trump of abuse of power in his senate impeachment trial romney was also one of just two gop senators to vote in favor of an ultimately failed motion to call witnesses all 15 senate impeachment trials before trumps had witnesses with their vote republicans blocked potentially crucial testimony from the presidents former national security adviser john bolton romney the 2012 gop presidential nominee has since been excoriated by fellow republicans and treated as a pariah stanley said there should have been mass protests in the streets after the vote against witnesses warning that the absence of significant public outcry served as a further sign to the party in power that they can go ahead and do what they want sen mitt romney announces his intention to vote to convict trump of abuse of power on february 5 reuters trump urged ukraine a vulnerable us ally to dig up dirt on his political rivals during a reelection year — including on former vice president joe biden who until recent electoral setbacks was thought to be the leading contender for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination and trump did so while withholding almost 400 million in vital congressionally approved military aid from kyiv as it fights a war against prorussian separatists there was a mountain of evidence that trump directed a broad complex scheme to essentially blackmail ukraine into smearing his political opponents but not all of the evidence was delivered under oath because republicans prevented key witnesses from testifying several senate republicans decried trumps actions toward ukraine but still voted to acquit him one such republican sen lisa murkowski of alaska conceded that she hadnt seen changes in trumps behavior since his impeachment despite her colleague sen susan collins of maine recently suggesting that the president had learned a lesson there havent been very strong indicators this week that he has murkowski told reporters on wednesday there is absolutely no reason for him to stop pushing from the moment he entered the republican primary in 2015 to his impeachment five years later donald trump has ignored advice to moderate and change and in his view which is largely correct won he has tested the boundaries of people and institutions several times and found them to be bendable and weak said cas mudde a political scientist at the university of georgia whos an expert on populism extremism and democracy there is absolutely no reason for him to stop pushing he added it goes against both his personality and his experience mudde said the only question is whether there is still a breaking point for the republican party note that trump has not changed the institutions so the powers are still there he said this is all about the courage and willingness of republicans to stand up for the rule of law and to the president since trumps acquittal hes ousted two key impeachment witnesses lt col alexander vindman a decorated iraq war veteran was pushed out of the national security council gordon sondland a republican donor who gave 1 million to trumps inauguration committee was fired as the uss ambassador to the european union within a week barr intervened in stones trial calling for a lesser sentence for the longtime gop strategist than the one recommended by prosecutors whod been working on the case on twitter trump celebrated the controversial intervention which led to the withdrawal or resignation of all four prosecutors working on stones case congratulations to attorney general bill barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought the president said theyll do whatever they can to hold on to power while the president applauded the attorney general stanley described barr as a dangerous authoritarian enabler adding that trump and those in his administration were not the only issues when it comes to an antidemocratic slide in the us its almost all of the republican party stanley said mitch mcconnell already showed that he has no loyalty to the rule of law when he denied obama the right to appoint supreme court justices its a much deeper problem he added we need conservatives and republicans to stand up for the rule of law and if we dont have that its over trump and william barr the attorney general reutersleah millis ruth benghiat a historian at new york university whos an expert on authoritarianism told insider that the resignations of the prosecutors over the interference with stones sentencing sent a powerful message of protest for trump and barr though this is likely good riddance to bad eggs benghiat said if americans are truly concerned with trumps abuse of power benghiat said the best strategy is for voters to mobilize and use their electoral power to vote out these authoritarians while they still can but with a president who was just impeached on allegations that he solicited foreign election interference and with republican lawmakers who appear fully willing to enable his behavior stanley said he was not particularly optimistic about election day in november i dont know what would happen in the absence of mass protests stanley said im not at all sanguine about the fairness of the upcoming elections he added as theyve shown theyll do whatever they can to hold on to power

avrzmz,2019-02-28 16:56:57,Democrats,The Badass Women of Congress Took on the Credit Reporting Industry and It Was Glorious,https://www.themarysue.com/congressional-women-credit-reporting/,ClimbeRocker,1090,45,obviously the big story dominating news out of congress this week is michael cohen’s testimony regarding all the crimes he says trump committed or asked him to commit but it wasn’t the only exciting event taking place the house committee on financial services held a hearing tuesday regarding a potential overhaul of the credit reporting industry and they absolutely killed it rep maxine waters who leads the committee has introduced a nearly 200page bill aiming to change the way giant corporations equifax experian and transunion collect and distribute americans’ information in a statement waters says in this broken system credit reports are routinely filled with errors that are difficult for consumers to correct negative information stays on for periods much longer than its predictive value medical debt continues to harm the credit standings of otherwise creditworthy consumers these problems are pervasive in the credit reporting system they directly impact how much we pay for a car loan whether or not we can get a mortgage and in some cases whether or not we can get a job america’s consumers deserve better than this these companies have been taking advantage of consumers for too long and with a democratled house and after equifax’s massive data breach in 2017 waters is finally able to do something about it and she’s not alone there are a lot of names on that committee but it was the newly elected freshman representatives–and specifically the women on the committee–who really made their mark at this hearing they stepped up to prove to their constituents that the platforms of change and anticorruption that they ran on were not just talk first waters questioned mark begor the ceo of equifax and made him explain why they have a plan that costs consumers 1995 a month “when a lot of what is being offered can be done for free” his response is basically that some people like paying 20 for nothing and that the other credit report bureaus do it too that’s a bs answer and she tells him so so we’re off to a good start repmaxinewaters “why should consumers pay 1995 a month when a lot of what is being offered can be done for free” equifax ceo “…consumers that want to avail themselves of it” waters “i don’t think that’s a sufficient answer to that question” pictwittercomcxmrxkfjru — afr realbankreform february 26 2019 california’s katie porter had a fantastic moment when she asked begor if he would reveal his social security number his birthdate and his address there during the public hearing obviously he wouldn’t fearing identity theft so why then are equifax’s lawyers “arguing in federal court that there was no injury and no harm created by your data breach” millions of people had their information stolen and equifax if just pretending like there’s no risk there repkatieporter to equifax ceo “if you agree that exposing information like what exists in your credit reports creates harm…why are your lawyers arguing in federal court that there was no injury no harm created by your data breach” pictwittercomfnfuce4ury — afr realbankreform february 26 2019 these companies consistently say that there’s no problem with that and that there’s no security issue with our total lack of ability to keep our data private clearly that’s not true but consumers–meaning all of us–have no say in the matter alexandria ocasiocortez was there to make begor state for everyone to hear that these companies collect our data without our consent begor says that there are ways for us to control or freeze our data but we cannot stop these companies from collecting it repaoc explains how credit bureaus profit off of consumer data “so consumers own their data but credit bureaus collect their data without their consent” equifax ceo yes pictwittercom6fs9vjl2cu — afr realbankreform february 26 2019 aoc also pointed out that approximately 1 in 5 people have reported an error on their credit reports “if parachutes has a 1 in 5 error rating i don’t think a lot of people would do skydiving” she said but again we have no choice in the collection of this information and it’s used to decide so many essential aspects of our lives from getting a car to a house to even a job rep rashida tlaib asked the three ceos how a credit score is necessary to get a decent rate for car insurance none of them could answer today rashidatlaib asked the three ceos of credit bureaus “what does a credit score say about the person’s driving history or their potential for accidents” none of them could answer because someone’s credit score has nothing to do with their driving the car and home insurance industry should not be using credit scoring this practice has targeted our residents for far too long httpstcoykgiunsiy5 — rashida tlaib rashidatlaib february 26 2019 these are issues that affect literally every single american but not every american is protected here reppressley speaks about her firsthand experience being a young hill staffer using a check casher “i know what it is to be underbanked and credit invisible” protectconsumers pictwittercomnexrwzzivr — afr realbankreform february 26 2019 the clear takeaway–the message the congresspeople were probing which was confirmed by consumer advocates on the panel–is that these corporations exist to sell data not to provide accurate information about a person’s responsibility level or their likelihood of defaulting on a financial obligation repaoc “do you think that credit bureaus are structurally incentivized to protectconsumers more than creditors” chi chi wu of nclc4consumers “absolutely not” pictwittercomr2f1hfxj4r — afr realbankreform february 26 2019 “a credit score is supposed to measure the likelihood of being 90 days late over a 2year payment period do you think that the current scoring algorithms structures are being designed with that specific metric in mind” jennifer brown unidosus “absolutely not” pictwittercomz8vdw1engr — afr realbankreform february 26 2019 it will be interesting to see where this bill goes from here as politico reports “while waters and consumer advocates have been pushing consumerfocused reforms for years the effort got an unexpected jolt of energy in 2017 when equifax revealed that millions of individuals’ information had been exposed in an historic cybersecurity breach” can we hope to see a few republicans willing to take a stand for consumer protections we’ll believe it when we see it but i sure hope we get to see it a big thank you to americans for financial reform realbankreform for these awesome videos image somodevillagetty images want more stories like this

donald trumps campaign on tuesday wednesday nzt for attacking democrat senator tammy duckworth escalating a conflict between trump and one of bidens potential running mates who is a purple heart recipient and a double amputee speaking at a virtual fundraiser that duckworth also attended the presumptive democratic nominee said it was disgusting sickening of trumps circle to question her patriotism and that it was a reflection of the depravity of whats going on in the white house right now the backandforth began on sunday when duckworth was asked on cnn about activists demands that statues of george washington be removed because he owned slaves duckworth replied that there should be a national dialogue on it at some point and when pressed further she added i think we should listen to everybody i think we should listen to the argument there fox news host tucker carlson then attacked duckworth on his show calling her a deeply silly and unimpressive person and suggesting that she and other democratic leaders actually hate america read more sexual assault allegation against joe biden resurfaces and prompts republican attacks us election bidens next big decision is choosing a running mate biden v trump get ready for a bitter us election showdown 2020 us presidential election who are the women likely to be joe bidens running mate duckworth a former army helicopter pilot who lost both legs in the iraq war shot back on twitter does tuckercarlson want to walk a mile in my legs and then tell me whether or not i love america on tuesday trump tweeted a clip of carlsons programme his campaign issued a statement from scott ogrady cochair of veterans for trump and patrick brady a medal of honor recipient charging that after saying she was open to tearing down statues of george washington tammy duckworth is now using her military service to deflect from her support for the leftwing campaign to villainise americas founding the dispute highlighted republicans growing eagerness to draw biden into a fight on culturally sensitive issues and attack his potential running mates some in trumps camp view them as better political targets than biden who is leading trump in the polls by a significant margin biden said last week that while statues of confederate leaders belong in museums and not public places he does not favour removing statues of washington thomas jefferson or christopher columbus the attacks on duckworth also underlined the challenge facing the democrats who are jockeying to become bidens running mate with republicans urgently looking for openings to attack them and highlight any differences they may have with biden duckworth has emerged as a serious contender in the biden campaigns vice presidential search according to three people with knowledge of the selection process it was not clear if the latest row with trump would affect her prospects one way or the other at tuesdays wednesday nzt fundraiser duckworth received encouragement from former presidential candidate andrew yang if joe has good advice our next vice president he said of the illinois democrat later yang said his support of duckworth was not an endorsement of her to be bidens running mate biden has said he is aiming to pick a running mate by early august and that he will choose a woman duckworth who is of thai and chinese descent is one of several women of colour in the running the fundraiser officially called the american asian pacific islander virtual event with vice president joe biden senator tammy duckworth and andrew yang drew 540 participants in her remarks duckworth criticised trump instead of trying to bring our country back together he spent his time defending dead confederates who took up arms against this nation and engaging in xenophobic and racist language geared toward many americans including the asian american and pacific islander community she said ap fox news host tucker carlson democratic presidential candidate joe biden and illinois senator tammy duckworth trump has made a push to preserve confederate symbols saying they are part of americas history and opposing calls by activists to dismantle memorials to those who fought to preserve slavery a representative for trumps campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on bidens or duckworths criticism carlsons broadside offered a potential preview of a line of attack republicans will likely use in an effort to undercut biden the host said on his show that bidens running mate will be the actual presidential candidate and biden will be a figurehead he presented no evidence for his claim but some republicans contend that at 77 biden would be a weak and potentially shortterm president an assertion he forcefully rejects the statement from ogrady and brady said that if duckworth cant defend george washington our first commander in chief those of us who still respect our founding fathers immense sacrifice and think america is worth fighting for will hold her accountable for cowering to the farleft fascists in the democrat party at the fundraiser biden praised duckworth as a patriot paying tribute to her moral and physical bravery i cant think of anyone who has shown more courage of both kinds i really mean it tammy biden said im grateful for you here with me in this fight he added youre the best i love you

He May Succeed. - His campaign’s cease & desist letter to broadcast stations is a frightening assault on free speech.,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/trump-political-ad-cease-and-desist-letter.html,anutensil,1072,33,over the course of his presidency donald trump has made thousands of false offensive and damaging claims that could hurt his reelection odds democrats plan to use these statements as campaign fodder through the november election on wednesday the trump campaign adopted a new tactic to neutralize these attacks it threatened to sue critics of the president in a brazen effort to censor trump’s opponents into silence any real legal action is unlikely to hold up against the first amendment but trump doesn’t need to succeed in court in order to win this threat came in the form of a ceaseanddesist letter sent to television broadcast stations across the country the letter orders these networks to stop airing an ad created by priorities usa a democratic super pac that ad “exponential threat” juxtaposes trump’s many dismissive comments about the pandemic with a chart tracking the rising number of infections in the united states it ends with one line of text “america needs a leader we can trust” as political ads go this one is fairly runofthemill the ad begins with trump saying “the coronavirus” then cuts to him saying “this is their new hoax” according to the trump campaign that edit renders the ad “patently false misleading and deceptive” its letter provides the full context of trump’s “hoax” remarks made during a rally here’s the key section coronavirus they’re politicizing it we did one of the great jobs you say “how’s president trump doing” “oh nothing nothing” … one of my people came up to me and said “mr president they tried to beat you on russia russia russia” that didn’t work out too well they couldn’t do it they tried the impeachment hoax that was on a perfect conversation they tried anything they tried it over and over they’ve been doing it since he got in it’s all turning they lost it’s all turning think of it think of it and this is their new hoax but you know we did something that’s been pretty amazing we have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early we went early we could have had a lot more than that when joe biden released an ad implying that trump called the coronavirus “a hoax” the letter points out factcheckers accused him of deceiving the public these factcheckers accepted trump’s later assertion that the “hoax” in question wasn’t the coronavirus but rather democrats’ efforts to “pin this on somebody” in context the true meaning seems more ambiguous like so many of trump’s wildest declarations it’s slippery enough that the president can claim innocence while his supporters can interpret it however they choose but it doesn’t really matter what trump meant because the priorities usa ad is obviously core political speech fully protected by the first amendment trump’s campaign suggests that it may seek to punish networks that air the ad in two ways suing for defamation and urging the federal communications commission to revoke their license although both approaches are deeply troubling assaults on free expression and may chill constitutionally protected expression neither is likely to succeed start with the fcc route the agency licenses local stations to broadcast on public airwaves and can theoretically terminate these licenses—though in practice it almost never does fcc rules require stations to run ads made by “legally qualified” candidates for federal office but not ads by super pacs which are supposed to be independent stations are supposed to act with reasonable care to prevent false or misleading ads but in reality it relies on the federal trade commission to penalize untruthful advertisers and even then the ftc typically goes after commercial advertisers not political ones in the past trump has floated the idea of challenging the licenses of broadcast stations that air “fake news” but the idea was and remains a nonstarter because today’s fcc simply does not revoke licenses on the basis of a station’s political speech allowing federal bureaucrats to censor political expression—even when it is arguably “misleading”—raises grave constitutional concerns with which the agency would rather not grapple the trump campaign may file complaints against stations that air the priorities usa ad but these grievances will cause the stations a minor headache at most and do not seriously jeopardize their licenses the possibility of a lawsuit is a more substantial menace trump’s campaign accuses stations of broadcasting “false information” and reserves its right “to pursue all legal remedies available” that translates to a defamation suit stations will have to devote significant time resources and money to fight off any legal action but they will probably prevail the first amendment was designed to safeguard political speech it requires public officials to prove that their critics knowingly lied or acted with reckless disregard for the truth to win defamation suits the supreme court has even granted constitutional protections to outright lies holding that an “interest in truthful discourse alone” is not “sufficient to sustain a ban on speech” following scotus’s lead lower courts have invalidated state laws that penalize knowingly false statements made by political campaigns put simply politicians and their allies have a first amendment right to stretch the truth when smearing their opponents and this right also shields outlets that carry their smears if the trump campaign does sue broadcast stations for airing priorities usa’s ad it will in all likelihood lose it would lose even if the ad peddled an outright falsehood rather than a tendentious recitation of the facts but its suit would still compel stations to spend sums of money defending themselves in court and therein lies the true danger here not that stations will actually lose in court but that they grow so afraid of legal action that they selfcensor trump is already trying to scare reporters out of covering him accurately he has threatened to sue several news organizations including cnn and his campaign filed a frivolous libel suit against the new york times media outlets are already on alert that trump might draw them into expensive legal battles in light of wednesday’s letter tv stations are also now aware of that risk they may refuse to run ads that contain factually debatable criticisms of the president for fear of a costly lawsuit meanwhile they will all continue to give airtime to the president’s incessant lies because they are newsworthy trump can use the power of the pulpit to tilt the playing field in his favor he could successfully monopolize the marketplace of ideas in the midst of his reelection campaign the trump campaign’s ceaseanddesist letter closes on a note of unintentional comedy declaring that “we will not stand idly by and allow you to broadcast false deceptive and misleading information concerning president’s trump’s healthcare positions without consequence” in fact no one lies about trump’s “healthcare positions” more than trump himself the president routinely pretends to support protections for preexisting conditions that his administration is currently fighting to overturn if tv stations could not broadcast false claims they would never air a single trump speech for better or worse trump has a right to manipulate the truth to his political advantage what he cannot do is gag his opponents when they try to punch back in kind for more on the impact of the coronavirus listen to this week’s what next tbd correction march 27 2020 this piece originally misidentified the name of the priorities usa ad as “existential threat”

portmanteau the president really tried to make happen as part of his 126tweet mothers day episode a more than 24hour meltdown and a bangup use of time during a global pandemic when the united states response is among the worst in the world already you can feel the credulous objective news media headlines coming president trump accuses obama of worse than watergate never mind whether there is any evidence for it or whether it even makes any sense at all this newest iteration of the routine involves michael flynn and seems to originate in part from his lawyer who went wild on fox business sunday but its always the same in every one of these conspiracies the awesome power of the deep state was allied with the obama administration in opposition to the election of donald j trump a simple businessman and patriot who just wanted to clean up washingtons corruption on behalf of the american people apparently this is done by pouring taxpayer money into your own businesses which trump refused to properly divest from on taking office and allowing industries to finish capturing the government departments nominally tasked with regulating them anyway a key protagonist in these vile plots is always james comey the fbi director appointed by obama and fired by the current president trump said on national television that he defenestrated the guy who was leading the russia investigation in part because of this russia thing robbie fimmano treat yourself to 85 years of historymaking journalism hearstmagscom 4000 shop now but james comey you see was a corrupt trump enemy trying to prevent the man who got millions fewer votes than his opponent from realizing his godgiven destiny to represent the will of the people as president so comey in this telling worked tirelessly as part of the deep state cabal to destroy donald trump which is why in the homestretch of the 2016 campaign comey intervened in the election—in explicit breach of justice department protocol—tocritically damage trumps opponent i mean are we going to pretend that comeys letter announcing the reopening of the investigation into the emails had no effect on the outcome the data says otherwise but even if his intervention was not decisive is that what you would do if you wanted to make hillary clinton president meanwhile he chose not to go public with the news the fbi was engaged in an investigation of the trump campaigns ties to russia which had been opened months before this all fails the most basic logical test in the process of constructing this entire ornate infrastructure of conspiracy and scandal the president and those on the particularly occult wing of his support have neglected the basic foundation or perhaps theyre just trying to obscure it comey broke the rules to intervene in the 2016 election in a way that damaged clinton not trump this is irreconcilable with the idea comey—and the extended deep state which is simultaneously allpowerful and incapable of stopping the aweinspiring tactical genius of donald trump—was part of some grand scheme if he was part of it his main contribution was to critically undermine the scheme james comey sucks but for other reasons jason kempin getty images the more straightforward explanation is that comey thought clinton would win but was worried the news that the fbi had found new emails on anthony weiners laptop would leak and he could be seen as protecting clinton there was reason to worry rudy giuliani even then a fullon trump apparatchik had his hooks in the fbis new york field office in this formulation comey is a selfish careerist who acted out of craven selfpreservation not one arm of a shadowy powerful and comically inept cabal oh and here we might mention that the trump administration has used private email accounts to conduct public business widely and repeatedly it is all a gigantic pile of manure at least the clinton foundation presented some genuine concerns about conflicts of interest which are now the operating principle of the current administration more than 80000 people are dead unemployment is near 15 percent and the federal government has no discernible strategy to get us out of the coronavirus pandemic and the accompanying lockdown we are not testing enough people to reopen safely because we did not use the two months weve all sat in lockdown to sufficiently ramp up our capacity the president is hoping people will get distracted with deep state conspiracies and culturewar bullshit while they gradually grow accustomed to watching

dlmjgh,2019-10-22 21:57:53,Democrats,"The Hillary Clinton emails story comes to an end: One of the worst media screw-ups in history, and nobody seems to have learned anything. The email story shows how double standards can develop and then produce shockingly unfair coverage in ways that absolutely affect the outcome of the race.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/21/hillary-clinton-emails-story-comes-an-end/,therecordcorrected,1056,67,i speak of course of the question of whether hillary clinton used the wrong email account and guess what a multiyear state department probe of emails that were sent to former secretary of state hillary clinton’s private computer server concluded there was no systemic or deliberate mishandling of classified information by department employees according to a report submitted to congress this month you don’t say with the possible exception of the credulousness granted to the george w bush administration’s propaganda push in advance of the iraq war the insane amount of coverage given to clinton’s emails was the worst media screwup of my lifetime and apart from an exception here or there you’ll find almost no journalists — and certainly no news organizations — willing to acknowledge how badly they blew this most minor of misdemeanors out of proportion the consequence is that donald trump is now the most powerful person on earth ad ad so what can we learn from that sorry episode from one perspective it was merely the culmination of a horrifically dysfunctional relationship between the clintons and the media in which legions of journalists decided that former president bill clinton and hillary clinton were corrupt and then followed that decision with another any particular story implying corruption or some other misdeed no matter how thinly supported or implausible had to be splashed across every front page and given hour upon hour of cable news coverage because after all they’d say “the story is out there” and “questions are being raised” all of which “plays into a narrative” but it’s about more than hillary clinton and this is where we have to prepare for the future the email story shows how double standards can develop and then produce shockingly unfair coverage in ways that absolutely affect the outcome of the race so while hundreds of stories were being written about clinton’s emails the trail of potentially scandalous behavior by trump was treated as barely worthy of attention you’d see a story or two about his shady casino bankruptcies or his stiffing small businesses out of money he owed them or about how his modeling agency exploited young foreign women in conditions one described as “modernday slavery” and then the story would disappear washed under a tide of “look at these crazy rallies trump is holding” reports at the same time the media were drawing false equivalencies between clinton and trump and treating her transgressions as far worse than his despite the fact that the opposite was obviously true ad ad it is important to understand it because “i know you are but what am i” is trump’s favorite argument and one he will absolutely use in 2020 he always accuses other people of the sins or crimes of which he is guilty we’re seeing it already the most corrupt president in history who among other things gave his daughter and soninlaw key jobs in the white house is charging that former vice president joe biden a democratic candidate for president helped his son make money in ukraine most gobsmacking of all the republican defense of his strongarming the ukrainian president into digging up dirt on the bidens is that trump — trump — did it just because he was so passionate about fighting corruption i’m sure there will come a moment when the president whose total of lies and misleading claims since taking office has rocketed past 13000 with no sign of slowing will charge his democratic opponent with dishonesty the news will then be filled with stories reading “president trump said today that his opponent is a liar because she told someone she had an egg mcmuffin for breakfast when in fact it may have been a sausage n egg mcmuffin our investigation raises new questions for the democrat about her candor” ad ad one way or another in an effort to show how evenhanded and unbiased they are in 2020 journalists will hammer on the democrat for a scandal real or imagined giving trump’s ludicrous attacks the amplification he seeks there will be some new version of “but her emails” unless we just decide not to

mcgrath is suiting up to enter the 2020 us senate race against republican majority leader mitch mcconnell the former marine fighter pilot ended months of speculation over whether she would make a run for one of the bluegrass state’s top seats in washington making the announcement with a video posted to youtube early tuesday morning ahead of an appearance on msnbc’s morning joe in the video mcgrath says she wrote to mcconnell when she was 13 telling him she wanted to fly combat jets and fight for the us when she was an adult he never wrote back she says in the video im amy mcgrath and ive often wondered how many other people did mitch mcconnell never take the time to write back or even think about the latestamy mcgraths senate campaign brings in record money in first 24 hours after announcement mcgraths name has been bounced around as a possible contender for the democratic nomination since her failed 2018 attempt to knock off rep andy barr in kentuckys 6th congressional district the rumors continued to take shape when it was reported earlier this year that senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york mcconnell’s counterpart and chief adversary was encouraging mcgrath to run 2020 us senate race5 things to know about amy mcgrath vs mitch mcconnell alsotrump tweets democrats coming after mcconnell as mcgrath enters race mcgrath a 44yearold georgetown mother of three has since been spotted at community events across the state and has regularly slammed mcconnell on social media tuesday morning on msnbc she said kentucky is ready for a change in the nations capital i think this is a message that kentuckians are ready for she said mcgrath who was painted as too liberal by republicans last year described herself as a moderate on the program she also tried to put some distance between her and national democrats running for president the kentucky democrat for instance said that she does not favor taking away private insurance as part of a federal overhaul and opposes subsidizing health insurance for undocumented immigrants as some presidential candidates haver indicated i think many kentuckians feel that we have a problem with getting health insurance for many americans so we need to fix that first mcgrath said on msnbc the opponentwhat to know about mcconnells senate reelection bid in kentucky readmcgrath seeks to make president an ally after announcing mcconnell challenge kevin golden mcconnells campaign manager said the senators reelection team is looking forward to the challenge from mcgrath given some of her past statements amy mcgrath lost her only race in a democratic wave election because she is an extreme liberal who is far out of touch with kentuckians golden said tuesday comparing president trump’s election to 911 endorsing a government takeover of health care and calling the wall stupid is a heckuva platform that we will be delighted to discuss over the next 16 months” the campaign posted a tweet tuesday welcoming mcgrath to the race and highlighting her past comments in support of abortion and criticizing the trump administrations plan to build a wall at the us southern border mcgrath has never held office but she said on tuesdays tv interview that shouldnt be held against her i’m not doing this because like i said i want to be some politician she said i‘m doing this because i care about my country and i care about kentucky reportsen mitch mcconnells family owned 14 slaves in alabama beating mcconnell who has served in the senate since 1985 wont be easy she acknowledged but she made the case that the longtime senator from kentucky has prevented president donald trump from passing legislation that people in the bluegrass state have supported such as bringing jobs to kentucky and lowering drug prices who stops them along the way who stops the president from doing these things mitch mcconnell mcgrath said and i think that that’s very important and that’s going to be my message – the things that kentuckians voted for trump for are not being done he’s not able to get it done because of senator mcconnell mcgrath swooped into kentucky’s political scene in august 2017 when she announced her upstart 2018 congressional campaign in a viral youtube video she brought no political experience to the race but carried a strong resume as a marine fighter pilot with 89 combat missions including bombings of alqaida and the taliban national democrats however weren’t sold on the neophyte’s candidacy and recruited thenlexington mayor jim gray as their preferred candidate mcgrath whipped him and four other democrats by a nearlandslide margin in the 2018 primary to claim the nomination opiniondespite loss mcgrath could be pivotal in kentucky democratic politics the mcgrath campaign in that race was defined by strong television and internet ads including her announcement video where she stood in front of a fighter jet wearing her bomber jacket she noted then as well how mcconnell never wrote back to her when she wrote to him about her dream to serve the country when she was 13 years old mcgrath retired from the marines in 2017 as a lieutenant colonel and moved back to kentucky at the urging of former us rep ben chandler she jumped into the house race against barr who had ousted chandler in 2012 as a candidate she favored saving the affordable care act but said she ultimately wants universal health care coverage for all americans she also supported the legalization of medical marijuana said that climate change is “a fact” and that kentucky should try to lead the nation in renewable energy republicans however hammered mcgrath relentlessly on abortion after she said “i don’t think the government should be involved in a woman’s right to choose what is happening to her body” the gop had a field day with leaked audio from a fundraiser in massachusetts in which she said “i am further left i am more progressive than anyone in the state of kentucky” and they quibbled over whether she had exaggerated her military record because during some of her combat missions she flew in the second seat rather than as a pilot as the democratic “blue wave” became the center of attention for the 2018 cycle mcgrath appeared poised to defeat barr but a lastminute visit by trump helped barr to victory by a little more than 3 percentage points but that put her squarely in the sights of national democrats who were looking for a candidate who could raise money from a national base to take on mcconnell – the man who she says never wrote back to her when she was a teenager mcconnell has already launched his reelection campaign it raked in 21 million since january and has 56 million in cash on hand the kentucky republican will lean heavily into how his majority leader role benefits the state while boasting about the success of giving the nation’s judiciary a conservative makeover since trump took office in 2017 mcconnell has relished in being the “grim reaper” for house democrats and liberal america as a whole killing off ideas coming from the house it started with him blocking former president barack obama from making a critical appointment to the us supreme court in 2016 for the past two and a half years mcconnell has talked about how he led the fight for our conservative values by helping confirm justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh who was hit with an allegation of sexual assault as a high school student in the middle of his confirmation kentucky is one of the states where trump remains popular and mcconnell will try mightily to remain behind that shield trump has a net approval in the state of plus 16 points according to the polling firm morning consult mcconnell conversely is the least popular us senator in the country according to the same surveys he has a net approval of negative 16 points republicans hold a 5347 majority in the senate with two independents caucusing with the democrats and its makeup will be essential for whoever controls the white house in 2021 democrats need a net gain of four seats if trump wins reelection or three seats if they take back the white house they are eyeing pickups in states such as colorado and maine which democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton won in 2016 but that means the party will also have to keep all of its current seats if mcconnell is still majority leader it will handicap a democratic president’s agenda that fact was acknowledged during the first democratic presidential debate on nbc when the first 10 candidates were asked by moderators if they had a plan to combat the kentucky republican being criticized for stopping the liberal agenda and confirming conservative judges i love it mcconnell told reporters in washington dc after the june 26 debate other democrats who are rumored to be considering a run in 2020 are house minority leader rocky adkins an eastern kentucky lawmaker who came in second in the gubernatorial primary and sports radio host matt jones who has built a powerful media empire for being known as the no 1 university of kentucky basketball fan jones has said publicly on his television program that mcgrath can’t win statewide coming off the heels of losing in the confines of central kentucky’s more moderate congressional district democrat steven cox of madisonville a health care professional is also running former state rep c wesley morgan a richmond liquor store owner is running in the republican primary

stephanie mccrummen of the washington post interviews jaime phillips at a greek restaurant in alexandria on wednesday dalton bennettthomas legrothe washington post a woman who falsely claimed to the washington post that roy moore the republican us senate candidate in alabama impregnated her as a teenager appears to work with an organization that uses deceptive tactics to secretly record conversations in an effort to embarrass its targets in a series of interviews over two weeks the woman shared a dramatic story about an alleged sexual relationship with moore in 1992 that led to an abortion when she was 15 during the interviews she repeatedly pressed post reporters to give their opinions on the effects that her claims could have on moore’s candidacy if she went public the post did not publish an article based on her unsubstantiated account when post reporters confronted her with inconsistencies in her story and an internet posting that raised doubts about her motivations she insisted that she was not working with any organization that targets journalists but on monday morning post reporters saw her walking into the new york offices of project veritas an organization that targets the mainstream news media and leftleaning groups the organization sets up undercover “stings” that involve using false cover stories and covert video recordings meant to expose what the group says is media bias james o’keefe the project veritas founder who was convicted of a misdemeanor in 2010 for using a fake identity to enter a federal building during a previous sting declined to answer questions about the woman outside the organization’s offices on monday morning shortly after the woman walked inside “i am not doing an interview right now so i’m not going to say a word” o’keefe said james o’keefe the founder of project veritas declined to answer questions from the post aaron davisthe washington post in a followup interview o’keefe declined to answer repeated questions about whether the woman was employed at project veritas he also did not respond when asked if he was working with moore former white house adviser and moore supporter stephen k bannon or republican strategists the group’s efforts illustrate the lengths to which activists have gone to try to discredit media outlets for reporting on allegations from multiple women that moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s moore has denied that he did anything improper a spokesman for moore’s campaign did not respond to a message seeking comment the woman who approached post reporters jaime t phillips did not respond to calls to her cellphone later monday her car remained in the project veritas parking lot for more than an hour the post positioned video reporters outside the group’s office in mamaroneck ny after determining that phillips lives in stamford conn and realizing that the two locations were just 16 miles apart two reporters followed her from her home as she drove to the office after phillips was observed entering the project veritas office the post made the unusual decision to report her previous offtherecord comments “we always honor ‘offtherecord’ agreements when they’re entered into in good faith” said martin baron the post’s executive editor “but this socalled offtherecord conversation was the essence of a scheme to deceive and embarrass us the intent by project veritas clearly was to publicize the conversation if we fell for the trap because of our customary journalistic rigor we weren’t fooled and we can’t honor an ‘offtherecord’ agreement that was solicited in maliciously bad faith” phillips’s arrival at the project veritas office capped a weekslong effort that began only hours after the post published an article on nov 9 that included allegations that moore once initiated a sexual encounter with a 14yearold named leigh corfman post reporter beth reinhard who cowrote the article about corfman received a cryptic email early the next morning “roy moore in alabama i might know something but i need to keep myself safe how do we do this” the apparent tipster wrote under an account with the name “lindsay james” the email’s subject line was “roy moore in al” the sender’s email address included “rolltide” the rallying cry of the university of alabama’s sports teams which are nicknamed the crimson tide reinhard sent an email asking if the person was willing to talk off the record “not sure if i trust the phone” came the reply “can we just stick to email” “i need to be confident that you can protect me before i will tell all” the person wrote in a subsequent email “i have stuff i’ve been hiding for a long time but maybe it should stay that way” the tipster’s email came amid counterattacks by moore supporters aimed at the post and its reporters that same day gateway pundit a conservative site spread a false story from a twitter account umpire43 that said “a family friend in alabama just told my wife that a wapo reporter named beth offer her 1000 to accuse roy moore” the twitter account which has a history of spreading misinformation has since been deleted the post like many other news organizations has a strict policy against paying people for information and did not do so in its coverage of moore on nov 14 a pastor in alabama said he received a voice mail from a man falsely claiming to be a post reporter and seeking women “willing to make damaging remarks” about moore for money no one associated with the post made any such call in the days that followed the purported tipster’s initial emails reinhard communicated with the woman through an encrypted text messaging service and spoke by phone with the person to set up a meeting when the woman suggested a meeting in new york reinhard told her she would have to know more about her story and her background the woman offered that her real name was jaime phillips phillips said she lived in new york but would be in the washington area during thanksgiving week and suggested meeting tuesday at a shopping mall in tysons corner va “i’m planning to do some shopping there so i’ll find a good place to meet before you get there” phillips wrote in a message sent via signal the encrypted messaging service when reinhard suggested bringing another reporter phillips wrote “i’m not really comfortable with anyone else being there this time” reinhard arrived to find phillips wearing a brown leather jacket and with long red hair already seated in a booth in the restaurant the 41yearold said she had been abused as a child reinhard said her family had moved often she said she moved in with an aunt in the talladega area of alabama and started attending a church youth group when she met moore in 1992 the year he became a county judge she said she was 15 she said they started a “secret” sexual relationship “i knew it wasn’t right but i didn’t care” she said she said that she got pregnant that moore talked her into an abortion and that he drove her to mississippi to get it in the interview she told reinhard that she was so upset she couldn’t finish her salad phillips said she had started thinking about coming forward after the allegations about hollywood film producer harvey weinstein surfaced then she said she saw the news about moore flashing across the television screen while in a break room at her job at a company called nfm lending in westchester county ny reinhard said phillips also repeatedly asked the reporter to guarantee her that moore would lose the election if she came forward reinhard told her in a subsequent text message that she could not predict what the impact would be reinhard said she also explained to phillips that her claims would have to be factchecked additionally reinhard asked her for documents that would corroborate or support her story later that day phillips told reinhard that she felt “anxiety negative energy after our meeting” text messages show “you just didn’t convince me that i should come forward” she wrote reinhard replied “i’m so sorry but i want to be straight with you about the factchecking process and the fact that we can’t guarantee what will happen as a result of another story” phillips was not satisfied on wednesday the day before thanksgiving she suggested meeting with another post reporter stephanie mccrummen who cowrote the initial article about corfman “i’d rather go to another paper than talk to you again” phillips told reinhard back at the newsroom reinhard became concerned about elements of phillips’s story phillips had said she lived in alabama only for a summer while a teenager but the cellphone number phillips provided had an alabama area code reinhard called nfm lending the company phillips said she worked for in westchester county but was told no one named jaime phillips worked there the company issued a statement after the publication of this article saying phillips worked briefly for marylandbased nfm lending but her tenure ended in the summer of 2016 the company also said it has no offices in westchester county alice crites a post researcher who was looking into phillips’s background found a document that strongly reinforced the reporters’ suspicions a web page for a fundraising campaign by someone with the same name it was on the website gofundmecom under the name jaime phillips the gofundme fundraising page internet archive “i’m moving to new york” the may 29 appeal said “i’ve accepted a job to work in the conservative media movement to combat the lies and deceipt of the liberal msm i’ll be using my skills as a researcher and factchecker to help our movement i was laid off from my mortgage job a few months ago and came across the opportunity to change my career path” in a march posting on its facebook page project veritas said it was seeking 12 new “undercover reporters” though the organization’s operatives use methods that are eschewed by mainstream journalists such as misrepresenting themselves a posting for the “journalist” job on the project veritas website that month warned that the job “is not a role for the faint of heart” the job’s listed goal “to adopt an alias persona gain access to an identified person of interest and persuade that person to reveal information” it also listed tasks that the job applicant should be able to master including “learning a script” “preparing a background story to support your role” “gaining an appointment or access to the target of the investigation” and “operating concealed recording equipment” project veritas founded in 2010 is a taxexempt charity that says its mission is to “investigate and expose corruption dishonesty selfdealing waste fraud and other misconduct” it raised 48 million and employed 38 people in 2016 according to its public tax filing it also had 92 volunteers o’keefe’s criminal record has caused the charity problems in some states mississippi and utah stripped the group of a license to raise money in those states because it failed to disclose o’keefe’s conviction on state applications records show also working at veritas is former television producer robert j halderman who was sentenced to six months in jail in 2010 after he was accused of trying to blackmail latenight host david letterman halderman was with o’keefe outside the project veritas offices monday as a reporter tried to ask about phillips’s role with the organization because jaime phillips is a relatively common name it wasn’t a certainty that the gofundme page that crites found was created by the same woman who approached the post but there was another telling detail in addition to the name one of two donations listed on the page was from a person whose name matched her daughter’s according to public records mccrummen agreed to meet phillips that afternoon phillips suggested meeting somewhere in alexandria va saying she was shopping in the area post video reporters accompanied mccrummen who brought a printout of the fundraising page to the interview again phillips had arrived early and was waiting for mccrummen her purse resting on the table when mccrummen put her purse near phillips’s purse to block a possible camera phillips moved hers the post video reporters sat separately unnoticed at an adjacent table phillips said she didn’t want to get into the details of what she had said happened between her and moore she said she wanted mccrummen to assure her that the article would result in moore’s defeat according to a recording mccrummen instead asked her about her story regarding moore phillips complained that president trump had endorsed moore “so my whole thing is like i want him to be completely taken out of the race” she said “and i really expected that was going to happen and now it’s not so i don’t know what you think about that” mccrummen asked phillips to verify her identity with a photo identification phillips provided a georgia driver’s license mccrummen then asked her about the gofundme page “we have a process of doing background checking backgrounds and this kind of thing so i wanted to ask you about one thing” mccrummen said pulling out a copy of the page and reading from it “so i just wanted to ask you if you could explain this and i also wanted to let you know jaime that this is being recorded and video recorded” “okay” phillips said “um yeah i was looking to take a job last summer in new york but it fell through” phillips said “yeah it was going to be with the daily caller but it ended up falling through so i wasn’t able to do it” when asked who at the daily caller interviewed her phillips said “kathy” pausing before adding the last name “johnson” paul conner executive editor of the daily caller said monday that no one with the name kathy johnson works for the publication and that he has no record of having personally interviewed phillips conner later said in an email that he had asked other top editors at the daily caller and the affiliated daily caller news foundation about phillips “none of us has interviewed a woman by the name jaime phillips” conner wrote at the alexandria restaurant on wednesday phillips also told the post that she had not been in contact with the moore campaign as the interview ended phillips told mccrummen she was not recording the conversation “i think i probably just want to cancel and not go through with it at this point” phillips said at souvlaki bar shortly before ending the interview “i’m not going to answer any more questions” she said “i think i’m just going to go” she picked up her coat and bag returned her drink to the front counter and left the restaurant by 7 pm the message on the gofundme page was gone replaced by a new one “campaign is complete and no longer active” it read correction a previous version of this story incorrectly said the nfm lending office a post reporter called to verify jaime phillips’s employment was in westchester county the company has no offices in that county this story has been updated with a statement from marylandbased nfm lending indicating that phillips’s brief

Arpaio, because Arpaio is a “champion” of “the rule of law.” It was a complete inversion of the truth, turning reality upside down.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2018/05/02/mike-pence-just-showed-why-trump-cant-be-trusted-with-pardon-power/,therecordcorrected,1039,78,in late july 2017 arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt after a federal judge ruled that he had deliberately ignored a court order to cease and desist his racial profiling of people who appeared to be latino arpaio’s brutality in abusing the rule of law is widely known the sheriff himself often boasted that prisoners in his draconian “tent city” jail would be exposed to temperatures of up to 142 degrees he referred to his compound as “a concentration camp” ad ad lawsuits mounted against arpaio – and again and again he lost in court judges ruled that his treatment of prisoners was abusive inhumane or unconstitutional or all of the above twice a federal judge ruled that the lack of medical care in tent city was so awful that it was an unconstitutional violation of prisoners’ basic rights onehundred fiftyseven deaths of prisoners occurred on his watch some of them allegedly attributable to negligence according to investigations by the phoenix new times vice president pence joe arpaio is the exact opposite of a “champion” of the rule of law and you’re embarrassing yourself and your office in claiming otherwise he ignored judicial orders abused the constitutional rights of prisoners and used his law enforcement powers as a racialized weapon that made a mockery of the notion that justice is blind yet arpaio was pardoned last year by the president of the united states why because arpaio was a political ally of president trump arpaio mirrors trump’s bigotry toward hispanics and even in 2018 arpaio continues to spread the despicable and debunked lie that president barack obama was born in kenya two bigoted conspiracy theorist peas in a pod ad ad not long after taking office in january 2017 trump reportedly talked with attorney general jeff sessions to ask whether there was anything that could be done to get the case against arpaio dropped — itself a highly improper intervention in an ongoing matter trump’s advisers told the president that he couldn’t interfere in the case itself but he could pardon sheriff joe that pardon which trump issued in august 2017 was appalling it sent a clear message trump’s political allies are now above the law those who abuse their law enforcement powers — particularly against ethnic minorities — will be rewarded but trump’s move was also widely seen by legal experts as a notsosubtle hint to potential witnesses in the ongoing criminal investigations into the president and his campaign if you stay loyal there might be a pardon waiting for you too this signaling could morph into an even more blatant abuse of power trump could use his pardon power to absolve key witnesses or investigative targets such as paul manafort or michael cohen how is it possible that in a democracy — a system differentiated from authoritarianism by the rule of law — that the president could simply exempt loyal cronies from the force of law simply to protect himself or his family how indeed was it possible that president bill clinton could pardon marc rich a criminal who appeared to have received a getoutofjailfree card in return for political donations to the clintons ad ad past abuses of pardons make it clear that it can and will happen again in the short term it’s imperative that members of congress make clear that they will impeach trump if he tries to use pardons to obstruct ongoing criminal investigations that affect him his political allies or his family but beyond that imminent threat it’s time for the presidential pardon — as we know it — to die american presidents should no longer be bestowed with a quasiautocratic upordown authority to twist the rule of law as they see fit of course pardons can have merits mercy correcting past injustices or finding ways to bridge political divides as was the case when george washington issued the first presidential pardon in 1795 after the socalled whiskey rebellion having a clemency safety valve as a check on the judiciary is important ad ad we should be able to agree however that pardons should not be given out as political favors to partisan loyalists or witnesses in ongoing criminal investigations that threaten the president that is nothing like what the founders intended in the long term a constitutional amendment to set up a bipartisan pardons commission may be needed but for now congressional republicans — and voters — must speak with one voice abuse the pardon power or support those who do and we will kick you out of office pence’s remarks about “sheriff joe” last night have highlighted yet again the trump administration’s disdain for the rule of law trump

8mpwta,2018-05-28 16:05:30,Democrats,Trump is blaming Democrats for separating migrant families at the border. That is a LIE. He and his administration are enforcing his OWN policy.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-is-blaming-democrats-for-separating-migrant-families-at-the-border-heres-why-this-isnt-a-surprise/2018/05/27/c07810d8-61d3-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html,wenchette,1037,90,in april more than 50000 migrants were apprehended or otherwise deemed “inadmissible” and administration officials have made clear that children will be separated from parents who enter the country illegally and are detained the surge in illegal border crossings is expected to continue as the economy improves and warmer weather arrives ad ad “i keep imagining somebody taking my kids from me my kids are 2 and 4 years old and that’s the age of some of the children that have been separated from their parents at the border” said rep joaquin castro dtex who is helping to organize a thursday rally in san antonio to highlight the issue “when a lot of people hear the story they get a similar reaction they can’t imagine why this would be a standard government practice” trump’s deflection offers a familiar playbook critics of the administration’s policies say in their view trump’s most recent comments are strategically similar to tactics he used when he ended the obamaera deferred action for childhood arrivals program and then insisted on hardline measures in a bill to permanently protect “dreamers” “he used daca kids as a bargaining chip and it didn’t work” said kevin appleby the senior director of international migration policy at the center for migration studies a nonpartisan think tank “so now he’s using vulnerable central american families for his nativist agenda it’s shameless” ad ad the situation threatens to reverse one of trump’s proudest accomplishments the sharp drop in illegal migration in the months after his november 2016 victory the recent uptick in numbers has left the president privately frustrated and top administration officials have pursued numerous ways to crack down on increased migration at the border for instance the administration worked with a handful of southern states earlier this year to deploy national guard troops to the border the justice department has dispatched more attorneys and judges to the border while the white house has ramped up its publicrelations offensive organizing recent roundtable events in both washington and on long island to underscore trump’s hardline stance ad and perhaps most aggressively the administration announced this month that the department of homeland security will refer to justice department prosecutors all who crossed the border illegally a move denounced by immigrant rights groups who say migrants coming to the border should be treated as asylum seekers ad the new zerotolerance policy will almost certainly mean parents who arrive with children will be separated because children cannot be detained in criminal jails those kids will then be deemed as unaccompanied minors whom federal law requires to be placed in the care of the department of health and human services as he detailed the “zerotolerance” policy during a pair of appearances may 7 attorney general jeff sessions stressed “if you don’t want your child separated then don’t bring them across the border illegally it’s not our fault that somebody does that” ad “my decision has been that anyone who breaks the law will be prosecuted” homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen said in senate testimony earlier this month “if you’re a parent or you’re a single person or you happen to have a family if you cross between the ports of entry we will refer you for prosecution you’ve broken us law” ad the new policy appears to be having immediate effects at a senate judiciary committee hearing on wednesday richard hudson the deputy chief of the operations program at customs and border protection told lawmakers that between may 6 and may 19 638 adults had been referred for prosecutions under the new “zerotolerance” effort those adults brought with them a total of 658 children hudson said who would have been separated under the new initiative a dhs official said sunday that many of those families may have already reunited if the detained parent had already been released from jail hhs and dhs have worked in tandem to reunite children with parents according to the official ad the administration has also emphasized that migrants arriving between official ports of entry will be considered illegal entries and will subsequently be referred for prosecution and families who seek asylum at a port of entry won’t be separated unless officials suspect smuggling is involved the official said ad but trump whose campaign pledge centered on a border wall that mexico would pay for has made it clear he is far from satisfied that he has fulfilled his immigration pledges “put pressure on the democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there sic parents once they cross the border into the us” trump tweeted saturday “catch and release lottery and chain must also go with it and we must continue building the wall democrats are protecting ms13 thugs” ad the white house in a statement late sunday rationalized trump’s comments by arguing that democrats’ refusal to close “loopholes” in immigration policy are causing the separation of families closing such loopholes according to the white house would allow families to be deported together to their home countries ad some of the loopholes the white house has referred to in the past include a 2008 antitrafficking law that prevents unaccompanied children from countries other than canada or mexico from being returned immediately and instead places them in hhs care while they wait for a hearing some of the children ultimately don’t appear for their hearings “sadly democrats openly oppose simple fixes to federal law that would stop the illegal migrant crisis and end the magnet for unlawful migration” said white house spokesman hogan gidley ad trump’s saturday tweet outlines a litany of demands he has made on congress which is controlled by republicans they include ending a visa lottery for people who hail from countries with lower levels of migration to the united states as well as restricting familybased immigration laws so us citizens could no longer sponsor relatives such as parents or siblings or “chain migration” ad rep mark meadows rnc one of trump’s closest allies in congress questioned sunday whether some of the adult migrants who show up at the border with children are really their parents citing humantrafficking concerns “we would have to address that” meadows said on cbs’s “face the nation” “but i think conservatives and moderates democrats and republicans all agree that keeping a family together is the best strategy and it’s something we need to address and will address” ad sen marco rubio rfla also speaking on “face the nation” advocated for tougher border security measures to send a “clear message” that illegal immigration to the united states would not be accepted “we have to understand a lot of these people that are crossing children are being trafficked here” rubio said “they are being brought here by criminal groups that help guide them and often take advantage of them and brutalize them on the path toward the united states and the ability to cross that border is a magnet that is drawing this behavior” ad the current intraparty fight among house republicans has largely focused on a citizenship path for “dreamers” prompted by a coalition of frustrated moderate gop lawmakers who have long pressed their leadership for action on the issue but a showdown over

a1dk4m,2018-11-29 05:22:52,Democrats,Here's what Ivanka Trump still doesn't get about her email problems: The truth here is that Ivanka Trump is guilty of the same entitlement mentality that her father and his surrogates accused Clinton of.,https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/28/politics/ivanka-trump-emails-gma/index.html,therecordcorrected,1026,43,cnn on tuesday ivanka trump sat down with abcs deborah roberts and was asked about recent revelations that she used a private email to conduct government business in 2017 it didnt go well in each episode of his weekly youtube show chris cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics click to subscribe roberts it has come to light that early in the administration you used your private email for white house business your father had taken hillary clinton to task for this so how did you wind up in a similar situation trump well there really is no equivalency all of my emails that relate to any form of government work which was mainly scheduling and logistics and managing the fact that i have a home life and a work life are all part of the public record theyre all stored on the white house system so everything has been preserved everything has been archived there just is no equivalency between the two roberts people see it as the same trump people who want to see it as the same see it as the same but the fact is that we all have private emails and personal emails to coordinate with her family we all receive content to those emails and theres no prohibition from using private email as long as its archived and as long as theres nothing in it thats classified roberts but your father hammered hillary clinton on this said that it was criminal she should be locked up trump in my case all of my emails are on the white house server theres no intent to circumvent and there were mass deletions after a subpoena was issued my emails have not been deleted nor was there anything of substance nothing confidential that was within them so theres no connection between the two things before we go any further its worth noting what specifically the washington post reported earlier this month on how and how much ivanka used a personal email to conduct white house business here are the two key paragraphs from the posts initial report ivanka trump sent hundreds of emails last year to white house aides cabinet officials and her assistants using a personal account many of them in violation of federal records rules according to people familiar with a white house examination of her correspondence some aides were startled by the volume of ivanka trumps personal emails — and taken aback by her response when questioned about the practice she said she was not familiar with some details of the rules according to people with knowledge of her reaction what ivanka trump is trying to do to lessen the fallout from the news of the email reveal is pretty simple seize on a critical difference between her email setup and that of hillary clintons as secretary of state and use that difference to prove that these situations have nothing in common she didnt delete email like hillary clinton and therefore she didnt do anything wrong it is true that clinton deleted more than half of the emails she sent from her private server after they were determined by someone who worked for clinton to be entirely personal and without any interest to fbi investigators looking into her decision to set up a private email server in the first place as i wrote at the time that was a very dumb decision by clinton and if ivanka is to be taken at her word every email she sent from her private email account has been preserved caveat worth noting ivanka said tuesday that all of my emails that relate to any form of government work are all part of the public record so who decided which emails didnt relate to any form of government work and where are the emails that were deemed as totally personal even if you buy ivankas story on her emails and how her situation is different from clintons it doesnt change this basic fact this all happened after a campaign in which her father now the president of the united states relentlessly bashed clinton for her decision to rely on a private email server while serving as the countrys top diplomat donald trump suggested clinton was hiding something nefarious that she had jeopardized national security by conducting business on a nongovernmental email address and that she broadly didnt think the rules applied to her how after that campaign can ivanka trump make a straightfaced argument that she didnt know what the rules were governing the use of a personal email account when conducting government business the answer of course is that she cant it is simply impossible to believe someone as involved in her fathers presidential campaign would be totally ignorant of the fact that it might be problematic to use a private email to conduct business when she was in the white house the truth here is that ivanka trump is guilty of the same entitlement mentality that her father and his surrogates accused clinton of seeing the rules of the road as something for other people to follow sure that whole email thing was a problem for hillary clinton but im ivanka trump im different that ivanka still doesnt get the real issue for her in her decision to use a private email address speaks to the bubble in which she lives and thats a problem
et8slf,2020-01-24 12:50:14,Democrats,Impeachment trial should remove any lingering doubt: Republicans are beyond redemption,https://www.salon.com/2020/01/23/impeachment-trial-should-remove-any-lingering-doubt-republicans-are-beyond-redemption/,Maddoktor2,1027,54,in liberal politically pluggedin circles it is an article of faith that if only democrats did something different they would do better at winning political battles dinner parties social media online chats listservs coffee hour all are consumed routinely by discussion of what tweak to democratic messaging would unlock all the political victories that we know belong to us progressivism vs centrism are identity politics good or bad should democrats embrace more forceful language or maintain a genteel tone play hardball or deliver placating language about bipartisanship this obsessive belief in the magic key democrats could turn that will solve our current political nightmare is fueling the rising hot tempers around the presidential primary we believe in our souls that the right candidate and right message will win this thing — and that the wrong candidate and wrong message will be a disaster we need to get these arguments exactly right we tell ourselves since thats what will save us advertisement yet as i watched the impeachment trial wednesday which featured the first day of democratic house members arguing before the senate in favor of removing donald trump from office i was struck by the fact that democrats were making a flawless case their evidence is overwhelming their arguments are airtight the rhetoric was pitchperfect it was a tour de force of enlightenment faith in the power of rhetoric and reason rep adam schiff kept morphing before my eyes into atticus finch as portrayed by gregory peck but lets not forget how to kill a mockingbird ends atticus loses his case and his innocent client tom is killed no matter how perfectly democrats argue their case republicans plan to acquit trump and their voters will be ecstatic about it our problem isnt the democrats and their messaging our problem is the republicans justice has no place in a society run by people who care only about domination and the will to power advertisement what used to be called the authoritarian tendencies of conservatives have grown unchecked and the parasite has now completely taken over the host body american conservatism is an authoritarian movement the american right has become enthralled with the same idea that has motivated fascists for decades which is that justice reason and reality itself do not matter — all that matters is raw power what the senate cameras recorded was a daylong showdown between reason and brute force lamented tom scocca at slate wednesday afternoon fascism cant be defeated by mockery any more than it can be defeated by debate because in its essence it is the antithesis of these things abigail nussbaum wrote in a powerful essay at her blog recently advertisement to the fascist she added it doesnt really matter if people point out that your rhetoric is lies and your leaders are ridiculous after all how clever are they going to look when you string them up in the town square this mentality is on full display with republicans during this impeachment trial faced with hours of immaculately presented unassailable proof of trumps guilt republican senators to the last one are responding with the rhetorical equivalent of fart noises and i know you are but what am i taunts advertisement sen roy blunt of missouri complained to reporters about hearing the same story over and and over again and being forced to watch the same exact video to make apparently another point republican senators whiled away the hours by pretending to be outraged that rep jerry nadler dny correctly accused them of a coverup sen ron johnson of wisconsin exclaimed that it was offensive to make such a charge and sen john cornyn of texas a smirk masquerading as a person called that suggestion outrageous and embarrassing from mockery to feigned outrage what holds together these republican responses is an unvarnished contempt for reason and facts and even more important outright scorn for anyone foolish enough to cling to those enlightenment notions of rational discourse advertisement but cling we do we tell ourselves we see clearly the situation at hand and we know full well that republicans have crossed the point of no return but we keep plugging away with our reasoned debate and logical arguments unable to see any viable alternatives this inability to look reality directly in the face is most evident on the democratic campaign trail which routinely features reporters asking the various contenders how they plan to pass their agenda — whether its centered on more modest reforms or sweeping ambitious goals — in the face of republican opposition oh every candidate has an answer ranging from sen bernie sanders arguing that his political revolution will awaken americans and put them on the right path to former vice president joe biden arguing that he can create bipartisan comity in the name of getting things done to sen elizabeth warren saying that passing an anticorruption package will smooth the way for other reforms advertisement all these answers are different flavors of bullshit the reality is republicans have disproportionate power pretty much baked in they will leverage that power to stop any and all democratic agenda items no matter how minor because under the leadership of trump and senate boss mitch mcconnell they have embraced a fascistic will to power philosophy no argument will move them since their goal is to crush their opponents and achieve total domination not to engage in governance based on rational debate and discourse still its hard to get too mad at democratic candidates for saying these things because the voters theyre trying to convince — liberals moderates anyone who isnt on board with the republican authoritarian nightmare — are all clutching to this hope that reason matters that our democratic traditions of argument evidence and logic can still win the day any candidate who fails to play to that hope is going to lose and they know it but watching the impeachment trial unfold and watching the perfectlywrought arguments presented by democrats evaporate into nothing as they hit the unbending wall of republican opposition one thing has become inarguably distressingly clear the only thing republicans respond to is power even if some have pangs of conscience and i have to imagine they do they are stifling any remaining care for our democratic values and wholeheartedly running toward the siren call of authoritarianism they are lost they arent coming back and its not just the party leaders or elected politicians either the last three years have been dominated by one unassailable number 42 thats the consistent baseline of donald trumps approval and while it occasionally dips when a small percentage of conservatives are momentarily flustered by his latest act of unforgivable evil those wafflers always come back around advertisement fortytwo percent is a terrifying number because its about more than trump that number represents the percentage of americans who have it appears wholly rejected reasoned discourse and democratic values due to the quirks in our electoral system that give disproportionate power to rural and suburban areas and due to voter suppression efforts from the gop that 42 will likely control the senate for the foreseeable future and will quite possibly win the presidency again in 2020 as the side that still believes in facts we have to grapple with these grim facts this endless obsessing over how the democrats could tweak their messaging isnt rational sure it feels good to keep harping on democrats because democrats actually listen to us and it creates the sensation of effectiveness but its a lot like a gambler blowing on dice before he rolls them baby needs a new pair of shoes its superstitious an effort to create a feeling of power when you have none even if the democrats figured out how to execute a perfect strategy which would be impossible even if it wasnt unknowable they cannot change that republicans backed by that 42 simply dont care sometimes the lever you have to pull just isnt the one thats the easiest to reach to be clear this situation isnt hopeless for one thing the majority of americans are still on the side of the angels all of this may be fixable if people rise up in big enough numbers to kick these authoritarian bastards out but one thing is certain were not getting any closer to the solution by expending our time and energy worrying about the democrats theyre not the real problem

propaganda.,https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/04/russia-spam-account-problem-reddit-propaganda/,progress18,1028,43,ive continued to hunt down russian propaganda said divesttrump who has requested anonymity to avoid online abuse its in the tens of thousands of posts and thousands of users are spreading it its incredibly pervasive these suspected russian propaganda sites have been targeting at least 89 subreddits in partnership with the data analytics company gravwell we scrutinized the nature and scale of these posts our findings suggest a russianled attempt to antagonize and influence americans online which is still ongoing the total subscriber base of all 89 subreddits is in excess of 68 million registered users the majority of the subreddits were conservative or rightleaning in content such as rconservativesonly rthedonald or rdraintheswamp but some of the largest subreddits with posts from these domains are also nonpartisan or leftleaning such as rworldnews ratheism or rcommunism at the time of writing reddit had banned six of the 89 subreddits although two of those were banned because they didnt have any moderators and not because reddit deemed that they had violated the rules of engagement additionally reddit has quarantined one of the subreddits r911truth which now comes with a misinformation warning before users can access the content the linkedin page of usareallycom lists its location as moscow and its social media manager is a moscowbased dimtry kukushkin another russian alexander malkevich created the website and he works for yevgeny prigozhin who has been indicted for interfering with us elections the fbi indictment says prigozhim bankrolled russias internet research agency which has been accused of being a troll factory the other website that divesttrump exposed last month brutalistpress left similarly easy breadcrumbs to follow in june 2017 a job listing was posted to a russian career website with alexbrutalistpress as the contact email address the advertised position was for a frontend developer with english skills who would work from home with the occasional work trip to st petersburg a lot of times these sites can look american sometimes they dont even try to cover their tracks which was the case with usareallycom they were registered they were hosted all out of st petersburg said divesttrump the website has since changed its host country to the united states but an archived whois record shows that usareallycom was originally registered in russia after posting the nowviral thread to reddit exposing the efforts of usareallycom and brutalistpress divesttrump told point and engadget that southfrontorg altrightcom and veteranstodaycom were behaving in very similar ways on reddit south front was previously flagged as suspicious by jessikka aro a researcher at the wilfried maartens centre for european studies in brussels in an academic paper published in the journal european view she cited southfrontorg as a prokremlin domain south front portrays itself as being a crowdsourced project but it looks more like a professional infowar project run or backed by the russian military she wrote other journalists have also named and shamed veteranstodaycom and altrightcom less than one percent of communities were responsible for 75 percent of antisocial behavior its hard to prove beyond doubt that a website is part of a misinformation campaign directed from the kremlin but researchers have shown that it only take a small band of devotees to influence the balance of an online conversation srijan kumar a postdoctoral researcher stanford university scrubbed reddits comments and carried out a datadriven analysis of conflicts on reddit he found that a few bad eggs can have a huge impact less than one percent of communities were responsible for 75 percent of antisocial behavior he said once a troll initiates the conflict by insulting a person or saying something extreme they simply sit back and watch the rest of the thread do the work for them explained kumar what a russian troll or bot could do is essentially start these conflicts so that people get more engaged in the community and that would increase the visibility of the community and therefore increase the anger that they have stirred gravwell conducted a sentiment analysis of the reddit posts using these domains and theres no shortage of this kind of behavior when we applied the machine learning from the training data its an overwhelmingly negative setup said gravwell cofounder corey thuen but sentiment analysis is not yet an exact science and thuen said the results have probably overestimated how negative the posts are because some positive ones were incorrectly identified as negative but the data we do have imperfect though it may be backs up the pattern of behavior that kumar from stanford university has studied point and engadget reached out to reddit for comment on this report but received no response credits

Moratorium,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/evictions-coronavirus-americans-homeless-covid-19-rent_n_5f209d31c5b66859f1f3545b,jonfla,1027,54,the federal moratorium on evictions expired last friday ending protections for nearly 12 million americans this friday 25 million people will stop receiving an extra 600 in weekly coronavirus relief in their unemployment benefits and on saturday rent is due for millions of americans who won’t be able to pay if congress doesn’t step in these people could be evicted come september and the worst part is that this looming crisis is completely avoidable all lawmakers need to do is take quick and decisive action by extending the moratorium and additional unemployment benefits as the pandemic crisis continues but that’s yet to happen on monday senate republicans unveiled a new covid19 relief package that did not include an eviction moratorium in spite of urging from democrats while negotiations are ongoing time is running out “we have the power to stop the coming avalanche of evictions during this pandemic that will hit black brown and poor communities the worst ― and we’ve already waited too long to act” sen elizabeth warren dmass told huffpost on tuesday evening “senate republicans have proposed giveaways to big banks and defense contractors but almost no support to help families keep their homes” added warren who last month introduced legislation that would extend the eviction moratorium until march 2021 “the next relief package must include my bill to extend and expand the eviction moratorium” even before coronavirus hit millions of families lived paycheck to paycheck with more than 20 million struggling to pay rent now with covid19 killing thousands and putting even more out of work the effects on americans’ abilities to pay rent have been devastating “it’s scary right now” laurin scarpelli an arizona mother of two told huffpost scarpelli said she is unable to return to work because she doesn’t have child care and is at high risk for covid19 complications “the safest place to be is at home if you’re going to lose your home what do you have” we have the power to stop the coming avalanche of evictions during this pandemic that will hit black brown and poor communities the worst sen elizabeth warren dmass just over 30 of us households were not able to pay their july rent on time according to a recent report from apartment list of those the majority were young and lowincome renters in urban areas as many as 23 million renters could be evicted by the end of september according to the covid19 eviction defense project with latinx and black renters affected the most that’s around the same percentage of households who believe they won’t be able to make their next monthly rent or mortgage payment a census bureau survey found the looming eviction crisis is both “completely predictable and entirely preventable” said diane yentel president and ceo of national low income housing coalition “if the federal eviction moratorium is not extended if the state and local eviction moratoriums that are scheduled to expire in the coming weeks do and if no emergency rental assistance is provided then from the end of august through fall millions of americans will be evicted from their homes” she added some states that implemented and then lifted rent moratoriums during the pandemic have seen an uptick in eviction cases when wisconsin lifted its state moratorium on rent increases in may milwaukee saw a 13 increase in eviction cases by the end of june twothirds of which were in majority black communities in contrast ithaca new york where 70 of residents rent became the first city to pass a resolution giving the mayor approval to cancel rent the proposal which is awaiting approval from gov andrew cuomo d would also ban evictions erik mcgregor via getty images tenants and housing activists gather for a rally and march in brooklyns bushwick neighborhood demanding that city administrators cancel rent immediately as the financial situation for many new yorkers remains dire amid the coronavirus pandemic “evictions disproportionately target black renters especially black women with children” said peter hepburn an eviction labprinceton university researcher “a wave of eviction serves to exacerbate entrenched racial inequalities in this country” as families lose their homes they’re forced to live in more densely populated places whether it’s in shelters on the streets or doubling up on housing arrangements ― conditions in which covid19 is more easily contracted states currently experiencing a record number of coronavirus cases are also expected to face high rates of evictions in the coming months in florida which recently shattered the us record for most coronavirus cases in a day 51 of renter households are at risk of eviction according to a cnbc analysis in texas a state that has also seen an alarming rise in cases 48 of residents are at risk of eviction the current crisis is “like nothing we’ve ever seen” john pollock coordinator of the national coalition for a civil right to counsel told cnbc in 2016 there were 23 million evictions according to princeton university’s eviction lab which tracks evictions in the us “there could be that many evictions in august” pollock said a surge of evictions could undermine the rental housing market hepburn said which could easily create a crisis “that would make the great recession look insignificant” for individuals who are evicted it can have a ripple effect that will last much longer than the pandemic “evictions inhibit your ability to find future housing they spoil your credit they often lead to job loss they can exacerbate health problems and lead to increased reports of stress depression and suicidal ideation” hepburn said over the next several days or weeks congress and the white house will have to decide whether they’re willing to let that happen larry kudlow white house economic adviser recently said he plans to “lengthen” the fourmonth federal eviction moratorium but later said the extension will only apply to federally financed housing not rentals senate minority leader chuck schumer dny and other democrats criticized the gop plan for lacking an eviction moratorium given many republicans’ opposition to an additional large spending bill on covid19 relief and democratic control of the house the democratic party will be vital in getting a package passed “if you can barely afford rent can’t find work can’t feed your kids or are fighting for your family’s future the republican plan leaves you out in the cold” schumer said tuesday

happened at least that’s how it would appear if you go by the official white house records of the event at one point in the presser reuters reporter jeff mason asked putin “president putin did you want president trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that” “yes i did yes i did because he talked about bringing the usrussia relationship back to normal” putin responded the white house’s transcript of the event leaves out the first part of mason’s question about wanting trump to win the election by omitting this it makes it seem that mason was asking about what putin had discussed prior to the question which was special counsel robert mueller‘s investigation there’s a simple explanation for this omission which is that people were talking at the same time indeed other transcripts of the event like bloomberg‘s left out the first part of mason’s question what cannot be quite as easily explained is why the beginning of mason’s question was edited out of the video of the event posted on the white house’s youtube channel around the 21823 mark of the video putin finishes his previous response and the next question from mason does not include that part where he asked about whether putin wanted trump to win ﻿ compare this to the following video of the event from nbc relevant part at the 43650 mark in the latter video mason can be clearly heard asking putin if he wanted trump to win the election and putin can then be heard responding to that question eliminating those portions from the video and transcript poses a legal problem as there are laws surrounding how official records are handled the presidential records act governs the management of documentary materials or any reasonably seg­regable portion thereof created or received by the president the president’s immediate staff or a unit or individual of the executive office of the president whose function is to advise or assist the president in the course of conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional statutory or other official or ceremonial duties of the president the act includes very specific instructions for how such records should be maintained or–when necessary–disposed disposal is deemed appropriate if the records “no longer have administrative historical informational or evidentiary value” it would be hard to argue that an official transcript and video of a press conference featuring the president and vladimir putin would fit that bill especially so soon after it took place now if the records of the press conference are not deemed to fall under the category of “presidential records” there’s still the federal records act that law applies to all recorded information regardless of form or characteristics made or received by a federal agency under federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization functions policies decisions procedures operations or other activities of the united states government or because of the informational value of data in them there is also a law against “concealment removal or mutilation” of government records it would be difficult to prove cases under any of these statutes however given the defense that the changes were not made with the intent to hide anything rather for some other editorial purpose again the transcript issue was not the white house’s alone and it’s arguable that the video was edited to match and to skip past the moment where multiple people were talking whether you buy that defense or course is a different story the edit clearly changes the meaning and nature of what is presented as being said in the white house’s version putin sounds like he’s expressing support for cooperating with special counsel robert mueller the full version indicates that he specifically wanted trump to win the 2016 election providing a motive for alleged offenses and possible collusion with the trump campaign meant to achieve that goal image via white house screengrab have a tip we

6enosb,2017-06-01 19:01:35,Democrats,Trump has granted more lobbyist waivers in 4 months than Obama did in 8 years,https://www.vox.com/2017/6/1/15723994/trump-ethics-waivers,Manny12,1019,101,on the campaign trail donald trump presented himself as the ultimate outsider who would rid washington of special interest corruption and “drain the swamp” and immediately after taking office he signed a flashy executive order tightening restrictions on lobbyists’ work in the executive branch but he immediately began to staff the administration with people whose work seemed on its face to clearly violate the terms of the order rather than publicly grant waivers of ethics rules with a clearly stated rationale the white house was simply routinely waiving ethics rules in secret so nobody knew how many waivers were issued or for what purpose after extensive back and forth with congressional democrats and the office of government ethics trump has finally provided documentation and it shows that the ethics rules are plainly meaningless he’s granted five times as many waivers in his first four months in office as obama did which cover key figures in the administration like chief of staff reince priebus chief strategist steve bannon and counselor kellyanne conway all told 17 waivers were granted to members of the white house staff and we still have no idea how many waivers have been granted for other executive branch agencies or whether anyone is even keeping track trump’s ethics pledge explained back in october 2016 with his poll numbers in a tailspin after the devastating revelation that he’d been caught on tape bragging about routine sexual assault trump unveiled a flashy series of promises to “drain the swamp” in washington and shake up the establishment with key party figures abandoning him and major republican donors focused on saving the house and senate rather than backing his candidacy it was a smart way of making lemons out of lemonade experts like new america’s lee drutman panned trump’s pledges as “fake reform” but as jeff stein argued last november there’s considerable evidence that it worked despite all the postelection kvetching about clinton’s message on the economy or lack thereof exit polls showed her decisively winning among voters who cited economic issues as their main interest trump dominated by contrast among voters who said they wanted “change” and preelection issue polling from both pew and gallup showed trump with a clear edge on just one issue — reducing special interest influence the specific elements of trump’s plan were however largely vague or unworkable first propose a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress propose a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress second impose a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal workforce through attrition exempting military public safety and public health impose a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal workforce through attrition exempting military public safety and public health third require that for every new federal regulation two existing regulations must be eliminated require that for every new federal regulation two existing regulations must be eliminated fourth put a fiveyear ban on white house and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service put a fiveyear ban on white house and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service fifth place a lifetime ban on white house officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government place a lifetime ban on white house officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government sixth put a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for american elections to the extent that trump could really do any of these things he packaged them into his january 28 executive order but as goodgovernment types found during the obama administration these kinds of executive branch commitments are inherently flimsy because what the president orders the president can also grant exceptions to and like trump obama ended up giving members of his administration waivers to allow them to work on regulatory issues tied to their former lobbying portfolios but while obama at least made an effort to make waivers the exception rather than the rule — to require them to meet the specific legal standard that nobody else in the administration could do a given task — trump seems to be simply waiving the rules willynilly and then doing his best to avoid disclosure when it’s happened some key white house waivers these waivers are in many cases particularly egregious andrew olmem for example joined the white house as special assistant to the president for financial policy after having lobbied the federal government on behalf of a number of financial firms including metlife his waiver allows him among other things to work on the subject of financial stability oversight council fsoc regulatory treatment of insurance companies as it happens the single most controversial thing fsoc has done over the course of its existence is designating metlife as being in need of enhanced regulatory supervision as the kind of entity whose selfinflicted imprudence and eventual failure could threaten the entire national economy michael catanzaro a lobbyist for a coalburning utility is working on the rollback of obamaera regulations on coalburning utilities shahira knight who lobbied for fidelity investments is now working on tax and retirement policy former lobbyists are in other words directly managing the white house end of the regulatory process on issues that directly implicate their clients’ core interests trump’s biggest broken promise trump’s public flagrant flouting of his promise to inaugurate a new era of more ethical and less conflicted federal government is less sexy than secret intelligence leaks about previously undisclosed contacts with russia but it’s in many ways worthy of more attention than it’s thus far received a lot of trumpera campaign promises were pretty clearly nonsense to anyone who bothered to do a fiveminute google search or else were mired in hopelessly contradictory rhetoric from day one but trump like him or not really was a political outsider whose nomination as president really was resisted by the top leadership of the republican party and who really was viewed warily by key congressional republicans right through election day and he really did rely much less on traditional campaign donors than the past few gop nominees or hillary clinton the whole trump show clearly discomfited the broad political establishment along a number of dimensions and it wasn’t obviously ridiculous to draw the inference that one thing the establishment feared about trump was the risk that he would shake up the existing cozy financial arrangement in reality trump’s white house is filled with lobbyists and waivers and we have no idea what kinds of rules are being waived in the various regulatory agencies beyond that even when trump has brought “outsiders” into the government they overwhelmingly pose their own financial conflicts of interest whether it’s jared kushner’s sister hawking eb5 visas health and human services secretary tom price trading on insider information wilbur ross’s stake in a chinese shipping firm or the decision to have a bunch of wall street lawyers run the securities and exchange commission the lines between private financial interests and public policy have never been blurrier than they are under the trump administration that starts from the top down where the president’s personal pledge to separate himself from his private business interests has been implemented in an utterly meaningless way and it carries forward to his implementation of his own selfimposed ethics rules the story of trump’s life from a young age has been the experience of the impunity enjoyed by rich people in america and his approach to ethics is simply to extend that impunity as far and wide as possible

the country election officials trying to ensure ballot access and protect public health in upcoming contests face an increasingly coordinated backlash from the right much of the onslaught of litigation has been funded by the republican national committee which has sought to block emergency measures related to covid19 such as proactively mailing ballots to voters sheltering at home ad ad “i think a lot of people cheat with mailin voting” trump who voted absentee in new york in 2018 said at a news conference friday offering no examples “i think people should vote in person with voter id i think voter id is very important and the reason they don’t want voter id is because they intend to cheat” democrats and their allies in the civil rights community are also seizing the moment arguing that the current crisis has created an urgent need for many of the voting policies they have pushed for years including mass expansion of mail balloting and relaxation of voter id signature and witness requirements with tense legislative and legal fights underway in three key states — and fresh battle lines being drawn in at least a dozen more — the viral outbreak has intensified a longrunning partisan fight over ballot access into a battle now playing out on multiple fronts ad ad the latest action occurred saturday in wisconsin where republican lawmakers who gathered for a special legislative session rebuffed pleas from gov tony evers d voting advocates election officials and even a federal judge to cancel inperson voting scheduled for tuesday and extend the deadline for mailin ballots “republicans in the legislature are playing politics with public safety and ignoring the urgency of this public health crisis” evers said in statement saturday evening “it’s wrong no one should have to choose between their health and their right to vote” ad the rnc is expected to spend more than 10 million on legal battles related to voting this year and is involved in lawsuits in minnesota michigan arizona florida and new mexico in addition to wisconsin ad party officials said their efforts are driven broadly by concerns that looser rules could lead to fraud “our position is really about protecting the integrity of the process” said rnc chief counsel justin riemer who is helping to coordinate litigation at the state level “the paramount concern is not on whether they help us win … our views on these issues are based on principle” some in the party have also publicly acknowledged concerns that higher voter turnout would harm the gop’s electoral fortunes — including those of the president himself ad late last month trump said a proposal by house democrats to expand mail balloting “had things — levels of voting that if you ever agreed to it you’d never have a republican elected in this country again” the georgia house speaker republican david ralston offered a similar view this week saying that an expansion of absentee voting would be “extremely devastating to republicans and conservatives in georgia” ad later ralston sought to clarify his remarks saying absentee voting is more prone to fraud wendy weiser director of the democracy program at the nonpartisan brennan center for justice at new york university school of law said such comments reveal that the “facade” is falling away for republicans revealing a “brazen desire to restrict access to voting” ad “that’s dangerous” she said “it’s just dangerous when we’re not even pretending to adhere to our country’s core democratic principles … when those get challenged by our leaders they erode” within the gop there is some apprehension that seeking to block attempts to make voting safer during a pandemic could backfire with millions of americans fearing for their safety and hoping to vote by mail in upcoming primaries and the general election in november gop resistance could thwart their own voters as much as it does democrats ad “i understand they want to win elections but it’s not clear to me that we gain advantage” said republican trey grayson the former secretary of state of kentucky “i also worry about the signal that it sends because there are people who are bothered by this we look as a party like we don’t care” ad on the local and state levels efforts to relax rules around voting do not break easily along party lines of the 18 states that have taken steps to ease absentee voting in response to coronavirus many have republican governors or secretaries of state and of the six states that have promised to proactively mail absentee ballot request forms to eligible voters five are deep red still national party officials have argued that efforts to expand voting access are not needed now in response to coronavirus they say that could change depending on the course of the pandemic ad however voting administrators say they are running out of time to expand mail voting for november ad tensions are high in wisconsin where voters and poll workers have expressed fears about risking their health to participate in tuesday’s primaries and municipal elections in milwaukee election administrators planned to open only five voting sites instead of the usual 180 republican leaders have argued that moving the date would sow confusion but their opponents say republicans are seeking to take advantage of the low turnout most officials expect on tuesday to help them win a closely contested race for a state supreme court seat the wisconsin senate’s majority leader republican scott l fitzgerald said last year that lower turnout would give justice daniel kelly a “better chance” of winning a new term on the court ad ad last month gop lawmakers rejected a proposal from evers to send a mail ballot to every voter and waive photo id and witness requirements at the time evers did not seek to cancel inperson voting despite health officials’ predictions of a wave of new infections across the state during the first two weeks of april republicans are also fighting us district judge william m conley’s decision thursday to extend the receipt deadline for mail ballots to april 13 and to allow voters to forgo a witness requirement if they are unable to find witnesses on friday a panel of the us court of appeals for the 7th circuit upheld conley’s ruling regarding the receipt deadline but granted a stay that blocks the counting of ballots with no witness signature gop legislative leaders on saturday filed an appeal of the ruling to the supreme court ad although conley declined democrats’ and election officials’ request that he cancel inperson voting tuesday he admonished both evers and lawmakers for not doing it themselves “wisconsin is obviously the real canary in the coal mine here that we’re all concerned about” nyu’s weiser said “seeing the breakdown there in the wisconsin legislature is a warning sign and something that raises significant concerns” republicans in new mexico are staking out similar territory with the state gop filing a lawsuit this week to block an effort by county clerks to hold the state’s june primary by mail gop leaders suggested that the switch would lead to voter fraud in north carolina republicans are opposing recommendations from the state board of elections to ease absentee voting restrictions including a requirement for signatures from two witnesses or a notary the debate is complicated by the fact that those rules were enacted just last year on a nearly unanimous vote following an explosive ballot fraud investigation that prompted north carolina officials to discard the results in a congressional race and repeat the election among other irregularities campaign operatives were accused of illegally collecting forging and turning in absentee ballots “in the very last election there was fraud that took place there was fraud here” said the state’s senate president republican phil berger in an interview “what responsible leader would want to go back to the policies that allowed that to take place” while some republicans may be taking advantage of the moment for political gain berger said democrats are doing the same — and in some cases he said trying to enable fraud for political gain yet resistance to loosening the rules could make it difficult — if not impossible — for some voters to cast ballots at a time when many communities are under orders not to congregate voting rights advocates say the risk is profound in urban areas with unreliable mail service and among african american voters whose forebears shed blood for the right to vote and who are mistrustful of mailing a ballot rather than feeding it directly into a tabulating machine elderly voters selfisolating with underlying health issues fall into the risk category too with greater likelihood of struggling with an unfamiliar process or being unable to find a witness experts said the voting challenges created by the pandemic come during a pivotal presidential election that already faces a range of threats including reported attempts by foreign powers to interfere in the campaign the coronavirus first collided with the democratic primary process on march 3 following the first hints of a us outbreak when election officials in super tuesday states began providing hand sanitizer for voters in the intervening month initial small steps to protect the public’s health have given way to primary delays in 17 states and a reinvigorated push by senate democrats to offer funding for votebymail systems around the country

said referencing anecdotes from her becoming book “so the day i left the white house and i write about how painful it was to sit on that inauguration stage a lot of our folks didn’t vote it was almost like a slap in the face” “i understand the people who voted for trump” she continued “the people who didn’t vote at all the young people the women that’s when you think man people think this is a game it wasn’t just in this election every midterm every time barack didn’t get the congress he needed that was because our folks didn’t show up after all that work they just couldn’t be bothered to vote at all that’s my trauma” it should be no surprise that becoming isn’t a trumpbashing attack ad though some might have wanted that even though shes freed from the scripted proprieties of the white house and is now speaking more casually and freely than she ever did as first lady it’s not exactly a part of michelle obama’s brand to do that where becoming reveals its value then is in the personal stories that uncover more about what life really was like those eight years for a black woman and mother plucked from obscurity to represent the most significant progress for african americans in united states political history an early anecdote reveals what her last day in the white house was like which was stressful for reasons you wouldn’t expect her daughters sasha and malia wanted to have one last sleepover with their friends she had a hell of a time clearing the house the next day “i was like ‘wake up the trumps are coming you gotta get up get out’” “i’m trying not to cry because if i walk out of there crying they’re going to say i’m crying for a different reason” she said when she got on air force one she sobbed for 30 minutes “the release of eight years of trying to do everything perfectly” “ it takes some energy to go high and we were exhausted from it ” there is also a fascinating story about the tea she had with laura bush between election and inauguration the white house butlers mostly older men of color served them the entire time all dressed to the nines in tuxedos in the moment she had a realization of a unique position she was in compared to other first ladies she was going to be raising two young black girls in that house she couldn’t have black men dressed in tuxedos serving them that’s not the image she wanted them to have of black men in their lives one of her first acts was to loosen the service staff’s dress code and daily duties “i am the former first lady of the united states and also the descendant of slaves” she said “it’s important to keep that truth right there my grandfather’s grandmother was in bondage people have been taught to believe in the ultimate inferiority of people because of the color of their skin” speaking more broadly about her experience as the first black first lady she said “you hope people were more ready for us than maybe they were” the burden she had to carry every day took a toll shouldering the best and the worst the country had to offer the highs and lows were extreme she remembers one day that had both in the morning she attended the funeral of the men and women who were killed during a bible study in charleston by the time she returned to dc that evening marriage equality for all passed in the supreme court from inside the white house which had been lit up like a rainbow she could hear the lgbt community celebrating outside the lawn on pennsylvania ave she needed to be a part of that feeling of love especially after that day one of the only times she pulled rank on security having just short of a meltdown and demanded to leave the house and go outside the appeal of becoming is essentially what the appeal of the book tour was in the first place obama is a magnetic engaging storyteller incredibly funny and capable of granting just the right amount of private access into her life to feel like you’re getting to know her—especially with her more casual conversational style outside of the white house it’s timely and yet frustrating it’s a time when people want answers and diatribes and rescue but michelle obama is just raising questions in dialogue with a nation trying to figure out what the eight years of that administration meant how to deal with the unease of right now and where we go from here “barack and i are not interested in being at the forefront forever” she said “not even for that much longer we got this platform if you believe in god god gave us this platform for a reason so let’s not waste it” that platform begins streaming on netflix on may 6

husband dressed in full indian garb it would have been a smash” trump mocked on twitter native americans weren’t laughing not only was the reference to pocahontas insulting as people have complained repeatedly but the casual reference to wounded knee — and the battle of little bighorn — as part of a disdainful joke astounded many “we condemn in the strongest possible terms the casual and callous use of these events as part of a political attack” said jefferson keel president of the national congress of american indians “hundreds of lakota cheyenne and arapaho people lost their lives at the hands of the invading us army during these events and their memories should not be desecrated as a rhetorical punch line” the chairman of the rosebud sioux tribe rodney bordeaux called the 1890 wounded knee massacre in south dakota “one of the darkest and most tragic chapters in the history of the sioux nation” in which as many as 400 unarmed native americans many of them women and children were slaughtered by us soldiers bordeaux called trump’s tweet “racist and disrespectful” and demanded the president apologize for his “shameful and ignorant misstatement” sioux tribal lawyer and

northern cheyenne and arapaho tribes fought the us cavalry led by lt col george custer the anger by the native americans is particularly sharp given trump’s ongoing campaign against immigrants and his insistence on a government shutdown until he gets 57 billion to build a wall along the southern border to native americans trump is an immigrant “flippant references to deadly historical conflicts and namecalling that mocks native identity have no place in our political discourse” said keel “i urge the president to focus instead on doing the people’s business including ending the needless government shutdown that is harming so many native people” storm reyes 69 a member of the puyallup tribe in washington state told the new york times that the president’s use of wounded knee was “equivalent to making a ‘joke’ about 911 pearl harbor or the holocaust” she said it was “awful that not only did trump use this tragedy as a joke weapon and insult but that his ignorance of american history is so great that he didn’t even know that wounded knee was a massacre and not a battle” as a native person puyallup tribe i cant begin to tell you how angry and sickened i am by this tweet

infection control was just one facet of a comprehensive initiative to reassess an industrys rules and regulations which had not been updated since 1991 aca leverage as part of the affordable care act the obama administration aimed to use the leverage of billions of dollars paid out through medicare and medicaid to these facility operators to get them to be more accountable and in the process reduce the costs incurred from unnecessary recurring hospitalizations from avoidable infections advertisement it was long overdue in december of 2017 the los angeles times published an eye opening investigative report by jordan rau with kaiser health news that told us all we would have needed to know about just how vulnerable these facilities would be to covid19 in 2020 basic steps to prevent infections — such as washing hands isolating contagious patients and keeping ill nurses and aides from coming to work — are routinely ignored in the nations nursing homes endangering residents and spreading hazardous germs rau wrote in 2017 a kaiser health news analysis of four years of federal inspection records shows 74 of nursing homes have been cited for lapses in infection control — more than for any other type of health violation advertisement rampant violations and while citations were common disciplinary action such as fines is rare nationwide only 1 of 75 homes found deficient in those four years has received a highlevel citation that can result in a financial penalty according to the kaiser study advertisement rau quoted michael connors of california advocates for nursing home reform a nonprofit in san francisco who said the industry was getting the message that they dont have to do anything because they are only getting lowlevel warnings year after year after year and the facilities have learned to ignore them but even as kaiser health news was shining a national spotlight on the lack of infection control in facilities where an increasing number of americans will spend their last days the trump administration was busy doing all it could to roll back the obama administrations effort to improve infection control in these places as the new york times reported on march 14 the federal regulator overseeing nursing homes proposed the rule changes last summer before the coronavirus pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of nursing homes to fastspreading diseases the push followed a spate of lobbying and campaign contributions by people in the nursinghome industry according to public records and interviews advertisement specifically last summer the center for medicare and medicaid services the same regulator that under obama had tried to upgrade infection control set in motion a plan to weaken rules… that required every nursing home to employ at least one specialist in preventing infections quid pro covid in november mr trump was honored by a group of nursing home operators at a fundraising event at a packed ballroom at the intercontinental hotel in midtown manhattan the times reported the event drummed up more than 3 million for his reelection campaign through a political action committee called america first action advertisement back in may of 2018 the roll back caught the attention of 17 of the nations state attorney generals who wrote the trump administration that the regulatory changes would not only threaten the mental and physical security of some of the most vulnerable residents of our states but short circuit their states ability to criminally prosecute bad actors in the industry the proposed regulatory rollback comes at a time when the us population is aging and in need of quality care in safe facilities wrote the attorneys general the number of people dependent on snfs skilled nursing facilities for healthcare is growing the population aged 65 and older is expected to double by 2060 and one in three people turning 65 will require nursing home care during their lives margin squeeze even before the coronavirus pandemic killed off tens of thousands of older americans in congregant living it was already a system in crisis in recent years the industry beefed up its profits by exploiting low wage workers primarily of color who were often recent immigrants advertisement at the same time the entire nursing home sector has struggled since the 1980s to find a sufficient supply of qualified nurses to handle the explosion in the number of longterm care patients whose chronic medical conditions required more attention the forprofithealthcare system has over the years underinvested in basic public health and medical education such that we lack a sufficient number of nursing educators to train the near 1 million additional nurses we will need before the end of 2030 a 2018 survey by the american association of colleges of nursing aacn found that 75029 competent applicants were refused admittance to nursing schools due to a lack of enough faculty healthlinecom reported the aacn reported nursing schools are struggling to fill faculty positions because a large number of current faculty members are on the verge of retirement nurses tend to earn a higher salary in clinical and privatesector settings and not enough nurses are choosing to continue their education the bureau of labor statistics writes that the demand for registered nurses will grow by 12 by 2028 compared to 7 growth across all occupations advertisement thanks to an aging baby boomer population climbing rates of chronic issues like obesity and diabetes and a growing emphasis on preventative care by 2030 the number of registered nurses needed in the united states is estimated to skyrocket by 284 from 28 million to 36 million tragically it was the lack of staffing in the here and now along with the lack of sufficient infection controls that ended up killing tens of thousands of patients along with an untold number of healthcare professionals

9n3yob,2018-10-11 00:57:12,Democrats,"Trump writes laughably false op-ed about Medicare for All: In a paranoid rant, Trump warns Americans that Democrats want to take away health care. Here's the truth.",https://thinkprogress.org/all-the-presidents-lies-about-medicare-for-all-52a141a12d1b/,therecordcorrected,988,74,president donald trump took a break from twitter wednesday to rail against medicare for all in a falsehoodridden oped for usa today despite promising voters on the campaign trail in 2016 that health care for all is “just human decency” the oped which editors clearly didn’t bother to factcheck contained dozens of lies about the health care proposal for which many democrats have advocated over the past two years the plan has various interpretations depending on which democrats you ask with some arguing for medicare expansion and others arguing for allowing people and employers to buy into medicare as a public option leaving private health insurance plans intact but what most people mean when they advocate for medicare for all — and what trump is attacking in his oped — is a single governmentrun health care system a proposal that is wildly popular with 70 percent of americans supportive of the plan indeed trump himself essentially argued in favor of medicare for all while he was running for president in 2016 telling msnbc “we’re going to take care of them we’re going to take care of them we have to take care of them now that’s not single payer that’s not anything that’s just human decency” here are the most egregious lies trump tells in the piece medicare for all “would end medicare as we know it” as thinkprogress’ ian milhiser previously reported the phrase “end medicare as we know it” is both “literally true and intentionally misleading” yes medicare for all would end medicare as we know it because the proposal aims to change the program from one that only covers some americans to one that covers all americans medicare for all “would cost an astonishing 326 trillion during its first 10 years” again while this is not necessarily a lie trump’s framing is grossly misleading the president cites a kochfunded study which yes found that medicare for all would cost 326 trillion over a decade what he fails to mention however is that the 326 trillion number is 2 trillion less than what the us currently spends on health care in other words medicare for all would save money “as a candidate i promised that we would protect coverage for patients with preexisting conditions … i have kept that promise” on the contrary trump has gone out of his way to ensure that people with preexisting conditions are not protected in june his administration told a federal court that it would no longer defend the affordable care act aca on the grounds that protections for people with preexisting conditions are unconstitutional this despite the norm that the federal government upholds and defends federal law “democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing medicare by more than 800 billion over 10 years to pay for obamacare” this is a favorite talking point of republicans that dates back to the 2012 presidential campaign trump revives it by citing a 2015 congressional budget office report that found that repealing the aca would add 802 billion to medicare spending but according to families usa the increase in medicare spending would “likely lead to higher premiums deductibles and cost sharing for beneficiaries and would accelerate the projected insolvency date of the medicare hospital insurance trust fund” advertisement the aca has in fact extended medicare solvency ensuring older americans have key health protections as the national association of area agencies on aging found “repealing the aca would eliminate efforts to close the medicare prescription drug coverage gap for up to nine million medicare beneficiaries exacerbating already difficult economic decisions for many vulnerable seniors” trump also argues that the democratic plan would “end choice for seniors” by getting rid of “other private health plans” as already mentioned these claims are misleading as they fail to mention that medicare for all proponents aim to expand medicare as a replacement for existing private health plans “democrats want openborders socialism” the great minds at usa today actually made this sentence a subhed in trump’s oped undeterred by the fact that it too is an egregious and fearmongering lie trump further claims that “democrats are radical socialists who want to model america’s economy after venezuela” medicare for all is not socialism however it would simply nationalize the insurance industry a plan dozens of developed countries including the united kingdom and canada have adopted trump riddles his piece with countless other lies which would take at least a thousand more words to debunk and it’s not surprising the gop has spent the last decade trying to dismantle health care and voters haven’t forgotten the disastrous and ultimately unsuccessful american health care act which would have repealed the aca and left millions of people uninsured advertisement with the midterm elections less than one month away it’s easy to see why trump and countless other republicans are now claiming to defend health care

father of a victim of the sandy hook elementary school massacre has won a defamation lawsuit against the authors of a book that claimed the shooting never happened – the latest victory for victims relatives who have been taking a more aggressive stance against conspiracy theorists the book nobody died at sandy hook has also been pulled to settle claims against its publisher filed by lenny pozner whose 6yearold son noah was killed in the shooting my facetoface interactions with mr pozner have led me to believe that mr pozner is telling the truth about the death of his son dave gahary the principal officer at publisher moon rock books said monday i extend my most heartfelt and sincere apology to the pozner family a wisconsin judge issued a summary judgment monday against authors james fetzer and mike palacek a ruling that was separate from the settlement between pozner and the book’s publisher a trial to decide damages has been set for october the fight against conspiracy theorists pozner has been pushing back for years against hoaxers who have harassed him subjected him to death threats and claimed that he was an actor and his son never existed he has spent years getting facebook and others to remove conspiracy videos and set up a website to debunk conspiracy theories lately the fight has been joined by others who lost relatives in the dec 14 2012 school shooting in newtown connecticut after quietly enduring harassment and ridiculous assertions for years some have changed their approach deciding the only way to stop it is to confront it their efforts have turned the tables on the hoaxers including alex jones host of the conspiracydriven infowars website robbie parker whose 6yearold daughter emilie was among 20 firstgraders and six educators killed at sandy hook spent years ignoring people who called him a crisis actor his family moved to the west coast but still the harassment didn’t stop he would get letters from people who found his address he was once stopped in a parking garage by a man who berated him and said the shooting never happened “you are taught when you are young that you ignore bullies and eventually they will leave you alone” parker said “but as time went on and my other girls were getting older i realized they weren’t stopping and some of this was getting worse and getting more personal” parker is now part of a lawsuit against jones has testified before congress and pushed for changes on social media platforms such as youtube which announced this month it will prohibit videos that deny the sandy hook shooting and other “welldocumented events” intimidationalex jones sent child pornography to sandy hook victims lawyer “it wasn’t until the lawsuits and until it became a mainstream news story that people realized they were being complicit in this and started to moderate the content” parker said pozner is the lead plaintiff in several of at least nine cases filed against sandy hook deniers in federal and state courts in connecticut florida texas and wisconsin in the case against jones the families of eight victims and a first responder say they’ve been subjected to harassment and death threats from his followers a connecticut judge ruled in the defamation case that jones must undergo a sworn deposition which is scheduled for july in texas on monday lawyers for the families disclosed that child pornography was found in electronic files sent to them by jones as part of the discovery process an attorney for jones said the pornography was in emails sent to his client that were never opened wisconsin’s dane county circuit judge frank remington ruled monday that pozner had been defamed by fetzer and palacek whose book claimed among other things that noah’s death certificate had been faked according to pozner’s lawyer jake zimmerman “if mr fetzer wants to believe that sandy hook never happened and that we are all crisis actors even that my son never existed he has the right to be wrong but he doesn’t have the right to broadcast those beliefs if they defame me or harass me” pozner said “he doesn’t have the right to use my baby’s image or our name as a marketing ploy to raise donations or sell his products he doesn’t have the right to convince others to hunt my family” before the case went to a judge fetzer had said “evidence clearly shows this wasn’t a massacre it was a fema drill” referring to the federal emergency management agency sandy hookmichelle obama opens up about the sandy hook shooting “if you believe otherwise then you are being played” fetzer a wisconsin resident said at the time a redacted copy of the actual death certificate is attached to pozner’s lawsuit additionally pozner has had dna samples taken and compared with those provided by the connecticut medical examiner to prove that noah was his son he has put noah’s birth certificate report cards and medical records into the public file in his legal actions his goal he says is to make sure that “normal people” have access to the truth and aren’t persuaded by the hoaxers a florida woman lucy richards was sentenced to five months in prison for sending pozner death threats she was also banned from visiting web sites run by conspiracy theorists including fetzer christopher mattei a lawyer who represents the families in their connecticut lawsuit against jones said his clients want to live their lives free from that kind of harassment they also want these hoaxers to know they are affecting real people who have already been emotionally devastated “when the grief process includes having to justify your grief or having to prove your child’s existence” he said “it makes it very difficult”

bcx7u2,2019-04-14 03:25:54,Democrats,Evangelical college students say they don’t want Mike Pence to be their commencement speaker - The vice president is facing backlash from students and alumni who say he doesn't represent their Christian values.,https://thinkprogress.org/evangelical-college-taylor-university-indiana-mike-pence-commencement-protest-181021c872ba/,madam1,988,41,students and alumni of a small christian college in indiana are pushing back against the state’s former governor — saying that vice president mike pence shouldn’t deliver the school’s commencement address because he doesn’t represent their christian values taylor university an evangelical school with about 1900 undergraduate students announced on thursday that pence had accepted an invitation to speak at its commencement ceremony in midmay “taylor university is pleased and honored to welcome to our campus and its 2019 commencement exercises vice president mike pence” paul lowell haines president of taylor university said in a statement “mr pence has been a good friend to the university over many years and is a christian brother whose life and values have exemplified what we strive to instill in our graduates” a sizeable group of current and former students however disagree a changeorg petition in protest of pence’s invitation to speak — which was launched by a taylor university alumni just a few hours after the school president’s announcement — has amassed more than 2800 signatures since its inception advertisement “inviting vice president pence to taylor university and giving him a coveted platform for his political views makes our alumni faculty staff and current students complicit in the trumppence administration’s policies which we believe are not consistent with the christian ethic of love we hold dear” the petition states alex hoekstra who started the petition graduated from taylor in 2007 as a gay man he feels “personally injured” by the policies championed by the trumppence administration and thinks university officials should recognize that those policies aren’t reflective of jesus’ teachings or the christian emphasis on love according to an interview he provided to newsweek that argument is echoed in many of the comments from other signatories of hoekstra’s petition many of whom write that pence doesn’t represent their faith “the politics and policies of vp pence and president trump are incongruous with the christian values the university is sworn to uphold” one supporter wrote “i stand for the values of that jesus promoted and when people in places of power so blatantly oppose those values or remain silent they should not receive such a privileged position” another commented advertisement writing in the christian magazine sojourners taylor university alumni c christopher smith argued pence represents a version of evangelicalism that doesn’t resonate with him or many of the other students and faculty at taylor “we need to ask ourselves the question to what sort of gospel do mike pence’s political values bear witness and is this the sort of gospel that we want to proclaim or to send out our young people out into the word with” smith writes “taylor university and other evangelical institutions should no longer give credence to this administration as representative of evangelicalism” similarly an adjunct professor at taylor amy peterson penned a washington post oped describing the hurt dismay and dissent among the campus community in the aftermath of the announcement that pence would deliver the commencement peterson acknowledged that the strong reaction to pence’s invitation may seem surprising to outsiders given that taylor university has a largely white evangelical and midwestern student body but she noted that evangelicalism is not a monolith — and argued that the school’s decision to invite pence sends the problematic message that there is just one acceptable way to enage in politics as an evangelical christian “inviting pence reinforces the creeping conflation of ‘evangelical’ with ‘republican” peterson writes “the question of how our political identity relates to our christian identity is up for debate in this cultural moment” advertisement pence is not a stranger to dissent during his visits to college campuses in 2017 as he delivered the commencement address at notre dame university — which is a catholic institution — a group of graduating students walked out in protest of the administration’s policies that target the most vulnerable americans but the controversy swirling around his invitation to taylor points to a larger tension within the christian community as progressive people of faith argue that major religious right figures — who have become the most visible representations of christianity in politics — don’t accurately reflect the version of the faith they practice for example pete buttigieg — a longshot 2020 presidential contender and the openly gay mayor of south bend indiana — has been frank about his religious background and outpsoken about the fact that he thinks it’s a mistake for democrats to cede the language of religion to republicans buttigieg is an episcopalian who says he wants to challenge the religious right’s monopoly on morality and faith buttigieg and pence have recently been engaged in a public backandforth about christian ideology and antilgbtq theology while giving a speech to an lgbtq equality group on sunday buttigieg directly addressed the vice president when he commented that his marriage to his husband has brought him closer to god one of the signatories of hoekstra’s petition called attention to the contrast between the two indiana politicians “i’m a husband of a taylor alum and suggest that if taylor is looking for a hoosier christian politician for the commencement they might consider inviting pete buttigieg” he wrote

resumed seeing patients saturday after a federal judge in louisville blocked the state from enforcing a new abortion law the general assembly passed the bill late thursday and it was signed soon after by gov matt bevin but us district judge david hale issued the temporary restraining order at 740 pm friday barring the state from enforcing senate bill 9 — the fetal heartbeat bill — which bans abortion once a heartbeat is detected usually around the sixth week of pregnancy bevin signed the bill just after midnight friday and because it carried an emergency declaration it took effect immediately that forced emw womens surgical center in louisville to turn patients away friday who had been scheduled for abortions said amber duke a spokeswoman for the aclu of kentucky which represents the clinic the clinic also had begun canceling patient appointments for saturday when staff learned the judge had blocked enforcement of sb 9 she said relatedkentucky is about to have 4 new abortion laws heres what to know on friday the aclu filed a lawsuit challenging the new law arguing it is unconstitutional in that it would effectively ban all abortions in kentucky because most women dont realize they are pregnant until at least six weeks into a pregnancy “taking another page straight out of the antiabortion playbook kentucky became the latest state to pass a law that will ban abortion before most women know they’re pregnant” said brigitte amiri deputy director with the aclu reproductive freedom project “these bans are blatantly unconstitutional and we will ask the court to strike it down” hales order later that same day citing the the strong likelihood of success of the aclus claim that the law is unconstitutional ordered that enactment of the law be delayed for 14 days until he is able to hold a hearing on the matter the supreme court has stated in no uncertain terms that regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances a state may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability hales order said citing a 1992 us supreme court ruling affirming its 1973 roe v wade decision legalizing abortion a fetus is considered viable at about 24 weeks from frankfort2019 kentucky legislative session the pension session that wasnt hales order said that senate bill 9 would effectively ban the vast majority of abortions in the commonwealth of kentucky and that if the law is enforced before a hearing patients would be immediately and irreparably harmed absent a temporary restraining order from this court hales order noted the law has an emergency clause that allowed it to take effect immediately but ”little explanation accompanies this declaration bevin an antiabortion republican signed the bill around midnight following the late thursday bill passing according to a news article the owensboro times posted friday the article cited as a source sen matt castlen a owensboro republican who was the primary sponsor of sb 9 bevin pledged support for antiabortion legislation in the 2019 session announcing at a right to life rally in frankfort last month that hes proud of being accused of being the most prolife governor in america bevins office did not announce the billsigning and did not immediately respond to a request for comment saturday republicans who control the general assembly indicated they are not worried about a court challenge or court costs in their fight to outlaw abortion this session the legislature passed four bills meant to eliminate or restrict abortion sen majority leader damon thayer a georgetown republican has said it would be the pinnacle of my career for kentucky to be the first state to get a case before the us supreme court that led to the reversal of roe v wade moreabortion is not same as slavery or lynching some kentucky lawmakers say even as house members voted final passage of sb 9 thursday some members warned it is unconstitutional including rep chris harris a pikeville democrat i consider myself prolife harris said but the constitutionality of this legislation has already been decided harris noted the state already is embroiled in three other lawsuits defending previous abortion laws passed by the legislature federal judges have struck down two and a decision on a third is pending in one case lawyers for

enlarge this image toggle caption nicholas kammap nicholas kammap with control of the us senate up for grabs in november republicans may have fights on their hands in states they have long taken for granted kansas for example the gop has held both of the states senate seats since the great depression however as they approach a monday june 1 filing deadline party leaders are not confident that any of the candidates now in the field are a lock to hold onto retiring sen pat robertss seat democrats hope that a victory in kansas in november can help deliver them a majority in the us senate which if they win the white house as well will provide a major boost to the partys legislative priorities those concerns prompted senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to intensify his efforts to convince us secretary of state mike pompeo to run the former gop congressman from kansas has rejected those overtures but rumors of a lastminute entry persist referencing the upcoming filing deadline in a recent interview on fox news mcconnell said i guess the suspense wont last much longer mike kuckelman chair of the kansas republican party said he has not heard anything from pompeo to indicate that the secretary of state has changed his mind i think hes been pretty clear that hes not going to run kuckelman said even so kansas senate president susan wagles abrupt decision thursday to drop out of the race signaled that party leaders were working behind the scenes to thin the field in an effort to avoid a bruising primary in a statement announcing her decision wagle said she had spoken with state and national party leaders and did not want to participate in a primary fight that will divide our party the announcement came only days after an interview in which wagle vowed to stay in the race unless pompeo got in ive talked to mike wagle said ive told him if he wants to get in im out however based on her conversations with pompeo wagle said i believe hell stay secretary of state thats more important several weeks ago kuckelman called on wagle and dave lindstrom a former player for the kansas city chiefs to exit the race both angrily declined wagles change of heart came on the heels of kansans for life the states leading antiabortion organization endorsing 1st district congressman roger marshall for the republican nomination while many of the candidates in field had strong antiabortion credentials the organization said in its endorsement that marshall a retired obstetrician from western kansas gives prolifers the best chance of defeating abortion fanatic barbara bollier bollier a state senator and retired physician from the kansas city suburb of mission hills is the presumptive democratic nominee a former republican she switched parties in 2018 after concluding she was an outlier on issues ranging from abortion to medicaid expansion the partys value system just didnt match mine bollier said during a recent teletown hall with voters part of what shes calling her virtual bus tour bollier thanks in part to contributions flooding in from across the country is outfundraising everyone in the republican field she raised more than 1 million her first month in the race and followed that up by taking in another 24 million in the first three months of this year former kansas democratic gov kathleen sebelius said bollier is the right candidate at the right time a doctor a nononsense legislator shes got the whole package said sebelius a former secretary of the us department of health and human services during the obama administration at a time when people are looking for compassionate competent government i think shes got a real shot sebelius said that is what worries republicans particularly if former kansas secretary of state kris kobach captures their nomination kobach is a polarizing figure his populist rhetoric and reputation as an antiimmigration hardliner make him a favorite of trump voters but alienate gop moderates and independents in announcing his candidacy last july kobach said he was not running to be the quiet useful tool sought by mcconnell the washington establishment is not going to get what they want if im elected he said to cheers at his announcement rally with backing from trump kobach narrowly won the republican nomination for governor in 2018 but lost the general election to democrat laura kelly that loss worries many republicans including marshall kobachs chief rival for the senate nomination who asks here we are in a state that president trump won by over 20 points how does a kansas republican lose a governors race several establishment republicans who share those concerns have endorsed marshall they include bob dole the former us senator and presidential candidate and former gov jeff colyer you are starting to see a consolidation of people behind roger marshall colyer said he is a candidate who can win a recent poll conducted by the national republican senatorial committee confirms the fears of some party leaders it shows kobach would be a dead heat at 44 to 43 in a headtohead matchup against bollier with 12 of voters undecided the kansas city star reported the same poll showed marshall leading bollier 46 to 35 with 18 undecided initial polls showed kobach leading in the race for the gop nomination but the most recent survey showed marshall with a 7point lead the primary is aug 4

Ted Cruz, R-Texas & Democratic opponent Beto O'Rourke will hold their 1st debate tonight at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.",https://www.texastribune.org/2018/09/21/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-debate-watch-texas-senate/,anutensil,980,41,dallas — us rep beto orourke of el paso the democratic nominee for us senate took a newly aggressive tack against republican incumbent ted cruz in their first debate friday evening appearing at southern methodist university the candidates exchanged rhetorical blows on just about every single question showing off sharp differences that have long been evident in the race but what stood out was orourkes combative posture toward cruz after spending his campaign until this point largely ignoring the incumbent and his attacks throughout the debate orourke repeatedly reminded viewers that he was the only candidate on the stage who has visited all 254 counties in texas — and forcefully pushed back several times as he came under fire from cruz “this is why people don’t like washington dc — you just said something that i did not say and attributed it to me orourke told cruz at one point this is your trick and the trade to confuse and incite based on fear and not to speak the truth that exchange was sparked by cruzs contention that orourke was stoking racial hatred against police following the shooting death of black dallas resident botham jean in his own apartment by white dallas police officer amber guyger guyger who was off duty at the time of the shooting has been charged with manslaughter after claiming she accidentally mistook jeans apartment for her own unit in the same building and thought he was an intruder orourke has voiced support for firing the officer while cruz has cautioned against a rush to judgment the debate was feisty from the opening question which was about whether dreamers — young people who were brought to the country illegally as children — should be given a path to citizenship holding firm on his support for that idea orourke charged cruz with promising to deport each and every single dreamer — that cannot be the way that texas leads on this issue without denying it cruz shot back that orourke is focused on fighting for illegal immigrants and that americans are dreamers even on the ostensibly positive last question — what do you admire about your opponent — cruz appeared to fit in a jab or at least a backhanded compliment going first orourke said that as a fellow member of congress he respected the sacrifice cruz was making with his family to do what he believed was best for the country when it was his turn cruz also commended orourke for making family sacrifices to serve in congress cruz then said he admired orourke for being passionate and believing in what he is fighting for — much like bernie sanders the selfdescribed democratic socialist cruz noted true to form orourke replied the topic of the debate was domestic policy it was moderated by nbc 5 political reporter julie fine and dallas morning news political writer gromer jeffers you can watch full video of the debate here in more current events the candidates were asked about brett kavanaugh the us supreme court nominee whose confirmation is in question as he faces a sexual misconduct allegation from his high school days cruz said the accuser deserves to be heard and treated with respect while o’rourke went further saying there needs to be an fbi investigation into the allegation the exchange quickly turned into a broader tiff over judicial nominees with cruz seeking to tie o’rourke to hillary clinton the 2016 democratic presidential nominee and claiming they both want judges who would effectively overturn the second amendment o’rourke denied that and offered another confrontational retort as cruz challenged him to name a judge he has supported who would defend the second amendment “you may not understand how the senate works but it’s your job in the senate to decide if youre going to support or not support” nominees o’rourke said — to which cruz pressed him on whether he endorsed clinton in 2016 he did and o’rourke insisted the question was irrelevant the second amendment fueled yet another showdown between the two as they differed on the need for gun control after the deadly shooting earlier this year at santa fe high school cruz said survivors told him they do not want gun control and instead want more armed police officers in schools orourke panned that idea saying teachers have told him they do not believe it will make them safer “thoughts and prayers sen cruz are just not gonna cut it anymore orourke said the people of texas — the children of texas — deserve action with the moderators seeking to move on cruz interjected to assert that “more armed police officers in our school is not thoughts and prayers i’m sorry that you don’t like thoughts and prayers cruz said i will pray for anyone in harm’s way but i will also do something about it” in more personal matters o’rourke was asked about his 1998 drunkdriving arrest — and whether he sought to leave the scene a detail that recently emerged about the incident that he has otherwise openly discussed citing state and local police reports the houston chronicle reported last month that a witness said he tried to flee o’rourke denied that “i did not try to leave the scene of the accident though driving drunk which i did is a terrible mistake for which there is no excuse” he said cruz said he did not “intend to get into congressman o’rourke’s personal history but i will keep the focus on issues” — and then pointed out o’rourke introduced legislation that would have effectively ended the automatic suspension of driver’s licenses for those convicted of drug offenses cruz and orourke mixed it up over nfl players kneeling during the national anthem which orourke has defended in comments that have received national attention orourke reiterated at the debate that he believes theres nothing more american than such nonviolent protests which the players say they are doing to draw attention to racial inequality cruz shot back at orourke that nowhere in his answer did he address that in cruzs view kneeling during the anthem is disrespectful to veterans players have a right to protest cruz added but they can do it in a way that does not disrespect the flag more fireworks flared up as cruz and orourke tackled the topic of their respective relationships with president donald trump orourke insisted he would work with anyone who has the best interests of texas in mind including trump cruz pounced in his response bringing up orourkes support for impeaching trump as far as i know congressman orourke has never spoken to the president other than to publicly call for his impeachment cruz said when you are leading the extreme left wing wanting to impeach the president that does not set you up for policy wins for texas cruz was asked whether he lost his dignity by supporting trump after losing to him in a bruising 2016 republican primary that saw trump deriding the senators wife and father cruz said that in an election unlike any other he made a conscious decision to put any personal hurt feelings aside for the good of texans ive got a responsibility which is to fight for everybody here and every person in this state he said cruz also touted this years income tax overhaul and job growth orourke though faulted cruz for not opposing trump more and said the president undermines american democratic institutions we need a junior senator who will stand up to this president orourke said when asked how they represent texas values both men took the opportunity to smear their opponent based on campaign contributions cruz painted orourke as a farleft ideologue beholden to liberal interests orourke portrayed cruz as someone who is captured by corporations and special interests the friday event was the first of three hourlong debates and it comes as polls continue to show a tight race between cruz and o’rourke an el paso congressman on friday morning the cook political report changed its rating of the race from “lean republican” to “toss up” the next two debates are scheduled for sept 30 in houston and oct 16 in san antonio early voting begins oct 22 it was only a week ago that o’rourke and cruz had announced an agreement to hold three debates capping weeks of negotiations between their campaigns o’rourke first challenged cruz to six debates in may and while cruz maintained he was open to debating his opponent he did not formally respond until july that is when cruz proposed five topical debates over three months in five cities among the issues that o’rourke had with cruz’s proposed debate schedule was every one fell on a friday evening during high school football season that was true for the dallas debate while the other two debates they ultimately agreed to are

ever seen before” that conflict is unfolding in plain sight the point of that weird campaign video trump rolled out at a white house press conference this week was to recast himself as bold and decisive in the face of the pandemic — as opposed to convincing reports in the new york times washington post and other outlets emerging recently that portray him and his administration as dithering and confused and slow to make crucial decisions like telling the country to start socially distancing it’s an extension of the challenge trump has posed to journalists from the start of his administration when he ordered his thenpress secretary sean spicer to tell the press that his inauguration had an enormous audience instead of a paltry one or in trump’s words delivered to a group of veterans in 2018 “just remember what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what’s happening” rosen who teaches journalism at new york university has been meeting up with me once a year to discuss the challenges the trump administration poses for the media this year instead of a podcast we chatted via skype and i’m presenting edited excerpts of that conversation below if you read the story i wrote earlier this week about the media’s struggles to report on the pandemic you’ll recognize similar themes in this conversation which was happening while i was reporting that story i’m grateful to rosen for the opportunity to shape my thinking the trumpera information gap peter kafka there’s a giant gap in the way the american public perceives or has perceived the pandemic that split is both across political divides and across news consumption divides are you surprised in any way to see what we’re seeing today jay rosen no peter kafka we have talked about this sort of gap for several years but did you imagine that this would manifest in a literal lifeanddeath crisis like this jay rosen no i never imagined a crisis like this i did like lots of other people worry about what would happen in a truly serious event combined with the trump presidency but i was thinking a war a terrorist attack a natural disaster of epic proportion something like that but something like this which affects everyone and is invisible and takes both science and imagination to understand — which i think is a very interesting point for us to discuss — i never conceived of something like this peter kafka there have been many failures i think one of them for a lot of people — and i include myself here — is a failure of imagination a failure to see this coming even though people have literally made books and movies about this for years jay rosen this possibility was talked about a lot and warnings for the virus began early and so there was plenty of information that it was going to become important but what i meant by imagination is something additional to that which is in order to understand what is happening now in order to be informed you need not only good information reliable information but you need imagination to see what it is peter kafka imagination buttressed with science jay rosen yeah that’s why dr anthony fauci and others say if it sounds like it’s too much it’s just enough but it’s an incredibly difficult thing to tell people about because unlike a hurricane or even a war the virus is completely abstract so that’s one of the challenges that journalists faced peter kafka right you can’t see it until you either have it or you’re looking at someone who has it even now one of the things that strikes me — and you see this manifesting on twitter — is that even now when there are thousands of people who have died because so much of it is happening in a hospital or in someone’s house or en route to the hospital that you’re not seeing it and while there’s plenty of reporting from inside hospitals in terms of visuals you’re still not seeing it and so you end up with scenes like people on twitter saying they’re going to the elmhurst hospital in queens to see if they can see these lines with people jay rosen that’s a whole meme now — go to your hospital and take video of nothing happening so that you can own the libs confusion and doubt as a strategy peter kafka are you tracking the percentage of people who say they are worried or not worried and how that’s evolving over time and what their sources of information are it seems like it has changed over time in part because at various times the president has said this is a serious thing after saying it was not a serious thing jay rosen yeah and this coheres with political science findings from long ago that public opinion does follow what political leaders and party leaders are saying the recognition that there’s a reality there that this thing is happening it’s real it’s not a story it’s not a fake — i think that has grown but as that has grown so has the attempt to escape responsibility for that and i think this is a really important point that i’ve been trying to make the fight to keep americans from understanding what happened from december to march is going to be one of the biggest propaganda battles in american history because so much of it is public we have so many statements from trump minimizing the danger so many things are already on the record the republican party and the trump campaign and the maga coalition are going to have to produce confusion and doubt on a scale that is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before and that of course is going to be a huge challenge for the press but it’s much more than the press i think the fight to interpret what happened in those first three months as someone else’s fault and to persuade americans that it wasn’t trump’s responsibility — when there are so many things on the record like “giving myself a 10 out of 10” or “this is going to go away it’ll just magically disappear” all those things are going to have to be overridden somehow and that is going to put a huge strain on the information system “the key for the trump campaign is to create confusion not belief and that’s what we’re going to see in the months ahead — is the massive effort to create doubt and confusion about things that are overwhelmingly clear from the public record” peter kafka in the pretrump era any politician let alone the president who not only said this once but downplayed the virus multiples times — made a whole series of statements that were then not rebutted but actually refuted — that would be the end of the story right it’s all on tape we know what it is there’s no doubt about it there’s no debate in the trump era sadly we’ve become used to the idea that trump can say something on live tv in front of everyone and then is actually able to make it go away magically and that there is a significant chunk of the population that either will never hear it or refuse to believe it or doesn’t care so you’re describing a fight to come but it seems like in some ways this won’t be a fight both sides will already be resigned to either believe trump or not believe trump is there any reason to believe it’s different this time jay rosen i think that’s a little oversimplified the trump base will believe anything that he believes and there’s already polling data indicating that his core supporters trust trump as a source of information far more than they trust the news media or any other institution so for that group yes then of course there’s a large group of trump doubters who are also not coincidentally more likely to think that the mainstream media can be trusted as a source of information but there are people who are in neither of those camps i wouldn’t call them centrist i wouldn’t try to characterize their ideology but they’re not in either one of those camps and for those people the key for the trump campaign is to create confusion not belief and that’s what we’re going to see in the months ahead the massive effort to create doubt and confusion about things that are overwhelmingly clear from the public record peter kafka one side says this the other side says that i can’t make up my mind i’m going to either ignore it or shrug my shoulders jay rosen yeah it’s already happening like new york city mayor bill de blasio does not have a great record in himself and warning his public he went to the gym way after it was too dangerous to do that and so there is some responsibility there right compared to trump’s responsibility it’s you know small but it’s real that kind of fact is going to interact with on the one handon the other hand journalism and they’re going to try and of course blow that up another thing that has already started happening is people keep sending me this graphic i don’t know who created it but i’ll send it to you that is all the headlines from various sources that minimized the virus that said it’s not going to be that big of a deal — some similar things to what trump said the attempt is to say that it was the “msm” — a term i don’t use but they do — it was the mainstream media that misled us why didn’t the media do better peter kafka i did want to ask you about that do you think the mainstream media — i’ll use the term — could have done a better job of raising the alarm earlier jay rosen probably yes as with other very big crises like the 2008 economic crisis you can go back and you can find reports that gave the appropriate warnings but the overall tone of the coverage did not accomplish that i think the same thing will be true here there are definitely reports — quite a few — that said this thing is bigger than the political system seems to be acknowledging and then even before this particular virus arose the possibility of a global virus like this having this kind of effect was very well known and discussed quite a bit so there is some responsibility there from the news media but the news media of course isn’t one organism “if the president and the white house were hair on fire about this there is no doubt there would be media coverage of the same type” peter kafka i’ve been thinking about this for a while i think there are probably two different reasons that the media broadly was not more alarmist about this one is a sincere desire not to be alarmist — in general and specifically over a health crisis if you’re telling people this is going to be terrible and you quote people who are stocking up on food you can have a run on markets jay rosen i think it would be part of the reason that you didn’t see kind of a “time out nothing else matters pay attention to this” that would be one reason but another way to look at it would be if the president and the white house were hair on fire about this there is no doubt there would be media coverage of the same type so that’s a factor as well there’s a lot of resistance to reporting on something that is a possibility peter kafka but the other thing is that for many journalists this reporting involved going to health experts — often the cdc centers for disease control and prevention or the who world health organization or people like that — and saying “what should we think about this” and then reporting what they say now we’re seeing that in some cases those institutions themselves were behind in sounding the alarm being more vocal about the alarm and some of their advice and prognostications have changed and it seems like that would pose a real challenge if you are a good reporter and you go to what is supposedly a nonpartisan institution staffed with experts and they’re saying this is our view — that it’d be very hard for you to run against that jay rosen i agree with that journalism scholars say that news reporters are dependent on “authorized knowers” this would be a very good example of that when the authorized knowers aren’t making a big deal of something it’s extremely difficult for journalists to do that “news” is a fundamental problem for the news peter kafka what do you make of the ben thompson argument that this is why twitter was particularly valuable because you had all sorts of experts on twitter — sometimes they weren’t sanctioned by the cdc sometimes they were smart people in silicon valley — and they’ve had insight and we should have listened to them more than the cdc or the who at various points jay rosen well if the question is the availability of information that warned us that this was coming — yes that information was available and you could find it in part by doing your own research that’s true but the problem is not really the availability of good information that turned out to be right and important it’s the combination of good information and public attention peter kafka which is kind of the job of the media to contextualize that information and to put it out jay rosen yes and to order things this is one of the problems we have with our news system the news tends to be to use a colloquial expression “one damn thing after another” and what it’s not that good at — even though people say that front pages do this — it’s not that good at helping us organize stories in order of priority like telling us what’s most important to worry about and next most important and maybe third or fourth and keeping those priorities both stable in the sense that they don’t change day to day but also be able to evolve as big events evolve we don’t really have anything like that and so it tends to be one damn thing after another if you just think about producing today’s news then a sense of hierarchy a sense of relative importance disappears from the flow of content this is a big problem with our news system it’s not the fault of any one journalist or any one news organization it’s a problem with relying on news for our knowledge peter kafka but there are hierarchies there’s the top of the newscast if you know how to interpret the new york times you know that the story on the far right is the most important even though it may be under a smaller headline than the rest of the page that is part of the job of media right packaging that and ordering it jay rosen yes but that tends to be a little bit different than what i said that’s “here’s the most important new thing that happened today” but some things are not new but they are the most important thing so some things are persistent and still the most important thing today and when you have things like that where actually the news of the day doesn’t change the fact that you should be worried about x y and z first — that’s where the system breaks down does this get better peter kafka i want to come back to the original idea here that i had when i was talking to you which was is there anything we can do about a partisan divide and a news source divide that is now literally a lifeanddeath situation is there any practical solution to this problem today in 2020 jay rosen well as the reality of the virus grows and everyday life is affected and people have extremely practical questions like “what do i do how do i protect my family” the news at the local level becomes extremely important because people need to know where to go what to do so it’s possible that local news providers will experience kind of a rebirth of both use and trust from the many questions and crises that arise from this situation and a relationship with a local news provider is basic to how people develop trust in journalism and in the news media as an institution and so if people’s connection to local news providers is strengthened by this — which does happen sometimes in civic emergencies like hurricanes for example — that could change things a little bit i don’t think it’s going to change opinion at the level of fox versus nbc and trump versus jonathan karl it doesn’t touch that but reestablishing trust and utility with local publics could help journalism quite a lot peter kafka that would be great and it would be great if we have local news outlets that are still around to perform that function jay rosen well this is part of the problem those newsrooms are themselves impoverished and so it makes it extremely difficult

Trump",https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-06-11/big-california-donors-open-wallets-money-pours-into-bidens-coffers,BlankVerse,976,20,it was another in an unrelenting procession of zoom fundraisers — the script familiar the donors determined not to be deterred by technical glitches and the candidate about to go through the motions — when joe biden revealed an expression of shock “wow” he said as the camera flicked to him on his side porch blooming flowers in the background the event’s hosts — california sen kamala harris and lt gov eleni kounalakis — had just revealed that the hourlong exchange tuesday evening would net his campaign 35 million it was a notable haul for a candidate whose careerlong struggle with fundraising has been a cause for high anxiety among some democrats and it wasn’t an outlier advertisement suddenly biden is raking in cash at a breathtaking clip reducing worries among democrats that his campaign would be overwhelmed by the war chest amassed by president trump “in the last week it has really come loose” said former california state controller steve westly a major biden fundraiser “trump is more erratic than ever people are afraid they are writing checks” at the same time that big donors many of them from california are digging into their wallets for biden he is also benefiting from a boom in smalldollar donations that has boosted budgets of progressive organizations nationwide propelled by an outpouring of support for racial justice groups the left’s main fundraising hub actblue has seen its previous daily record for donations in 2020 broken repeatedly this month advertisement the sustained gush of dollars heading biden’s way also reflects a growing confidence among large donors that the former vice president’s campaign has begun to get its act together after weeks in which many of them criticized it for being unfocused understaffed and unsophisticated the party’s presumed nominee has built bridges to his more progressive primary rivals hastening the pace at which their backers are falling into line a campaign that not long ago seemed technologically inept has upped its zoom game “to call people and say ‘please give me 100000 for a 50minute zoom call with no qa no shaking hands with the candidate’ it’s not the easiest ask” said wade randlett who is helping coordinate biden’s fundraising in the bay area yet donors are stepping up more quickly and willingly than even randlett — an eternal biden optimist — anticipated “i have been pleasantly surprised” he said the biden campaign declined to reveal how much it has raised so far in june but figures from individual events along with the campaign’s recent aggressive use of socialmedia advertising all point toward big numbers the campaign has added 12 million names to its email list in just 10 days biden aides said advertisement the democratic national committee has raised more at the beginning of this month than it has at the start of any other month since it began using actblue in 2017 according to party officials the party’s fundraising is outpacing what it was at this point in october and november 2018 when a massive cash influx

enter email address sign me up you may occasionally receive promotional content from the los angeles times while biden still may not generate intense enthusiasm from democratic activists that no longer seems to be holding them back from writing checks “are people saying ‘oh my god i am so excited about joe biden’ no” said one west coast bundler of big contributions who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity “but they don’t care nobody cares if you are not excited they just want trump out” advertisement a catalyst for wealthier donors was seeing current and former military leaders raising alarms about trump’s use of federal troops to confront protesters the bundler said “once the generals came out people were like ‘this is really frightening’” part of the fundraising success reflects an overall surge of contributions to groups on the left that has followed the killing of george floyd by minneapolis police and the subsequent nationwide wave of protests established civil rights groups like the national assn for the advancement of colored people and the southern poverty law center have benefited but the surge has most acutely transformed frontline activist organizations some of which had tiny budgets only a few weeks ago a small organization called the minnesota freedom fund which posts bail for arrested protesters and others awaiting trial raised 20 million in four days earlier this month a memorial fund for floyd created by his brother philonise had a goal of raising 15 million on gofundme it has already climbed past 14 million advertisement “it is an expression of people’s solidarity with the movement” said pilar weiss director of the community justice exchange which runs a nationwide directory of bail funds called the national bail fund network “the scale is bigger than anything we have seen in the recent past” some 35 million people have given a total of 60 million to community bail funds over the last two weeks democratic outrage over trump’s response to the protests as well as his handling of the coronavirus crisis has propelled donors off the sidelines much earlier than was anticipated “the series of crises and inflection moments the country is facing is spurring donors to get into the game far earlier and far more generously than they were planning” said lily adams a spokeswoman for unite the country a super pac supporting biden “folks are watching this president bungle crisis after crisis … and thinking how traumatic it would be to have four more years of this it energizes them to give” advertisement and those who can afford it are free to write much bigger checks to biden than only weeks ago now that he has clinched the nomination the democratic national committee has entered into a joint fundraising agreement that allows donors to give up to 620600 the trump campaign has a similar arrangement with the republican national committee trump is responding with his own fundraising offensive on thursday he planned to hold his first inperson donor gathering since the pandemic’s stayathome orders took hold aiming to raise 10 million at an event in dallas the move has generated discussion among democrats about whether biden can keep up without taking the same health risks as trump and holding inperson meetings so far however biden is doing just fine on zoom “three months ago i was skeptical and i thought it would be really hard to do this” westly said of virtual events “the fact is people are getting used to zoom everybody is on it” advertisement use of the technology has enabled the candidate to raise money far more efficiently than in the past when courting big checks necessitated jetting all over the country zoom turned out to be a perfectly suitable venue for biden to persuade a group of wealthy climate activists that he can walk the walk on their issue a recent virtual event raised 4 million from just 25 activists who bought tickets with a starting price of 100000 “people don’t actually know that much about joe biden which sounds funny to say about a guy who has been at the center of american politics for so long” said billionaire climate activist tom steyer who cohosted the zoom event with venture capitalist swati mylavarapu her husband nest cofounder matt rogers and nicole systrom a cleantech entrepreneur the donors who paid to show up “were really really impressed by his performance” said steyer who was among biden’s democratic primary rivals “some of them did not realize how much he knows how much he cares how high he prioritizes this” advertisement events at the steyer residence in san francisco had in the past been a big draw for donors but he’s now bullish about zoom so is susie tompkins buell the soughtafter progressive donor in san francisco whose elegant penthouse apartment with sweeping views of the bay area has hosted some of the most memorable presidential fundraisers over the years “the efficiency is incredible” she said of zoom fundraising “people understand that they would rather contribute to an efficient system and see money go toward what needs to be done than go to some fancy party and rub elbows with people they don’t

axg5r8,2019-03-05 04:58:24,Democrats,"‘Impeachable’ and ‘illegal’ aren’t interchangeable -- In a groundbreaking announcement, the House Judiciary Committee opened a far-reaching investigation into President Trump and his associates. The scope of the investigation is enormous: Obstruction of Justice. Public Corruption. Abuses of Power.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/04/impeachable-illegal-arent-interchangable/,therecordcorrected,961,30,ad it would be wrong to assume that this is the first step toward impeachment democratic leaders have made clear that absent bipartisan agreement that trump must go there is little point to impeaching in the house and then losing the trial in the senate nadler’s investigation isn’t necessarily or even likely a prelude to impeachment given republicans’ refusal to put country above party however it is always possible that the findings will be so overwhelming that impeachment or resignation becomes a real possibility ad let’s also keep in mind that the scope of the investigation is so expansive that it’s unlikely to be completed this year if it does run into 2020 the election and not impeachment is most likely to determine trump’s fate it’s important to understand that the house judiciary committee will look at three categories crimes that are not impeachable crimes that are impeachable and noncriminal actions that are impeachable ad certainly there are crimes that many would not consider of sufficient severity to justify impeachment that’s why the constitutional standard is “high crimes and misdemeanors” these may entail crimes which are insufficiently severe eg leaving the scene of an accident or single instances of misjudgment eg lying under oath about sex such crimes may or may not be prosecuted after a candidate leaves office and may or may not affect voters’ willingness to reelect the president ad then there are crimes that are plainly impeachable especially if they are part of an ongoing pervasive pattern in this category would be ongoing tax and bank fraud conspiracy to defraud voters in an election and to violate campaign laws obstruction of justice including witnesstampering and intimidation and other crimes that go to the heart of the judicial process which the president is sworn to defend the most interesting category is actions that aren’t crimes but which are impeachable let’s take the allegation in jane mayer’s blockbuster new yorker report that trump allegedly ordered economic adviser gary cohn and chief of staff john kelly to file suit to block the att and time warner merger because of the president’s vendetta against cnn a time warner entity there is nothing illegal about filing a lawsuit but — as with the nixon white house ordering internal revenue service audits of political enemies — using the power of the federal government for personal reasons is plainly an abuse of power cohn never carried out the order the justice department filed suit in the normal course of business and the federal court upheld the merger ad “of all the scandals that have enveloped the trump administration the one theme that keeps returning time and again is his attempt to politicize law enforcement” says former justice department spokesman matthew miller “this is just another example of how he sees doj as his personal enforcement agent there to punish his enemies and reward his friends and it is the grossest abuse of power possible” ad constitutional scholar larry tribe agrees telling me “if trump did order cohn to take that action it would’ve been a clear abuse of presidential power in violation of the first amendment” this wouldn’t of course be the first time trump used government powers to suppress critics “this revelation further bolsters an already damning record that we’ve laid out in a federal lawsuit that the president has violated the first amendment by trying to use the vast powers of the federal government to suppress speech he doesn’t like says ian bassin executive director of protect democracy every american who cherishes our rights not only to speak freely but to receive reporting and information not slanted by the pressure of government censors — and make no mistake this is an attempt at censorship by other means — should be outraged at trump’s utter disdain for our first founding freedom” ad it would be a mistake to brush off this particular trump directive and other alleged orders eg fire the special counsel get a us attorney to unrecuse himself from a southern district of new york probe because underlings didn’t carry them out ad joshua matz and tribe write “if trump’s abusive orders to senior officials were actually implemented as policy they would support multiple articles of impeachment the widespread practice of ignoring his tweets statements and even direct commands — or treating them as merely advisory — has thus saved trump from potentially dire political consequences” however fortunate we have been trump’s orders nevertheless represent serious abuses of authority especially when others’ constitutional rights are involved likewise it might not have been illegal for trump to pursue a business deal in moscow during the campaign to lie to voters that he wasn’t pursuing a deal and to use his position as a candidate to defend a hostile foreign power and increase his chances of landing a deal but defrauding the voters to gain power — and aiding a foe of the country in the process — most certainly could be considered an impeachable offense indeed the framers were concerned about those who gained power by illegitimate means ad right now we don’t know what illegal acts if any trump committed and which if any are impeachable i suspect we are going to begin to find out however republicans’ blanket defense of anything trump says or does and their unwillingness to defend the constitution should come with a price in watching them defend corruption obstruction and abuse of power voters may come to view them as enablers of trump and just as unworthy of reelection ad
9n9gq3,2018-10-11 15:19:16,Democrats,Fact-checking President Trump’s USA Today op-ed on ‘Medicare-for-All’ -- President Trump wrote an opinion article for USA Today regarding proposals to expand Medicare to all Americans in which almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a falsehood.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/10/fact-checking-president-trumps-usa-today-op-ed-medicare-for-all/,therecordcorrected,969,62,but this is not a serious effort to debate the issue so as a reader service we offer a guide through trump’s rhetoric ad ad “throughout the year we have seen democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives” sanders has unveiled a plan he calls “medicareforall” essentially it is a singlepayer plan that means all of the bills would be paid by one entity — the federal government — in contrast to the hodgepodge healthcare system now in place medicare the health care system for the elderly and disabled is a federal singlepayer plan but people under 65 get insurance from employers through the individual market obamacare or through medicaid the federalstate health system for the poor private health insurance plans such as those offered through employers would be eliminated according to the congressional research service sanders says he would first improve medicare for seniors and the disabled by eliminating deductibles and covering dental vision and hearing aids which are not covered under current law then over the course of four years the eligibility age would be lowered in stages until every american was covered ad ad on paper at least the sanders plan would improve benefits for seniors not take them away there are several other versions including proposals more limited in scope such as “medicarex” that would simply offer a medicare option as a buyin the kaiser family foundation has a useful guide to the differences “as a candidate i promised that we would protect coverage for patients with preexisting conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums i have kept that promise and we are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down” trump made this promise but broke it he supported republican plans that would have weakened protections for individuals with preexisting conditions his administration also has refused to defend the affordable care act against a lawsuit that would undermine those protections in effect the trump administration no longer supports a provision of the aca aka obamacare that makes it possible for people to buy insurance if they have preexisting health conditions we labeled this as a flipflop ad ad as for premiums they have continued to increase on average just at a lower rate than in the past but experts say that without trump’s moves to weaken the affordable care act premiums would be even lower in many states “i also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect medicare that is why i am fighting so hard against the democrats plan that would eviscerate medicare” under trump the date for when the medicare hospital insurance part a trust fund will be depleted keeps advancing the current projection is 2026 three years earlier than the projection a year earlier part a is financed mainly through payroll taxes of 145 percent on earnings paid both by workers and employers selfemployed people pay 29 percent the money raised is then credited to a payasyougo trust fund which uses the revenue raised to pay the benefits of medicare beneficiaries ad ad with the babyboom generation retiring at a rate of 10000 people per day that puts pressure on the longterm financing of the program because fewer workers will be supporting more retirees if the trust fund is depleted that means the government would not be able to cover 100 percent of estimated expenses yet because of trump’s tax cut the budget deficit is soaring even as the economy is booming in contrast to previous periods of under4percent unemployment that leaves the government less prepared to deal with the consequences of babyboom retirements “democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing medicare by more than 800 billion over 10 years to pay for obamacare” trump resurrects a misleading republican talking point from the 2012 election ad the affordable care act actually strengthened the nearterm outlook of the part a trust fund the law includes a 09 percent payroll tax that hits the wages and selfemployment income of wealthier americans — above 250000 per couple or 200000 for a single taxpayer that was estimated to raise an additional 63 billion for the part a trust fund between 2010 and 2019 the law also was estimated to cut expenses including 162 billion in productivity adjustments to provider payments and 86 billion in reduced payments to medicare advantage plans the net result was that the “insolvency” date was extended by 12 years ad in other words the savings that trump complains about mostly were wrung from healthcare providers not medicare beneficiaries — who as a result of the health care law ended up with new benefits for preventive care and prescription drugs moreover the 800 billion in medicare reductions in the aca that trump complains about are the law of the land in fact republicans in congress and the trump administration in their budget plans have pocketed virtually all those savings — and sought even more reductions in medicare spending on top of that trump proposed 350 billion in net medicare cuts in his budget — and there were about 540 billion in medicare cuts assumed in the house gop budget plan ad “the democrats plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised” ad as noted the sanders plan in theory would expand benefits for seniors “the democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care doctors and hospitals would be put out of business seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors there would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures previously covered care would effectively be denied” this is a scare scenario obviously a transition to singlepayer health care would lead to upheaval and uncertainty since it would encompass the entire health care system not just the small piece covered by obamacare but other countries appear to manage with singlepayer systems at lower costs than the united states trump’s vision of what would happen under singlepayer echoes the fears evoked by opponents of medicare in the 1960s and obamacare in 2010 so there’s a chickenlittle feel to this language ad ad here for instance is ronald reagan in 1961 warning against the creation of medicare “the democrats plan also would mean the end of choice for seniors over their own healthcare decisions instead democrats would give total power and control over seniors’ health care decisions to the bureaucrats in washington dc” medicare is currently a governmentrun program with hospital and doctor fees paid by the government so this appears to be an absurd point “the new democrats are radical socialists who want to model america’s economy after venezuela” venezuela is collapsing after years of neardictatorship and squandering of oil wealth but we are unaware of any democratic leader who has pointed to venezuela as an economic model ad “some democrats absolute commitment to end enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing immigration and customs enforcement that means millions more would cross our borders illegally and take advantage of health care paid for by american taxpayers” ad some democrats have been calling to abolish us immigration and customs enforcement but it’s not a widely held position other democrats say the agency should be reformed not abolished in any case ice is only one of several agencies tasked with immigration enforcement “democrats will seek to slash budgets for seniors’ medicare social security and defense” trump may have a point about defense spending never a favorite among the left but the president’s 1 trillion deficits will put pressure on all aspects of government no matter who is in power democrats generally have pushed to expand social security benefits not cut them “republicans believe that a medicare program that was created for seniors and paid for by seniors their entire lives should always be protected and preserved” as a technical matter current retirees receive far more in benefits than they have paid into the system according to the urban institute younger workers are going to have subsidize the babyboomers moving into retirement meanwhile for years house republicans led by speaker paul d ryan rwis have pushed for a significant overhaul of medicare retirees would get from the government what ryan called “premium support” — a set payment adjusted to inflation they would have used that money to pick from a range of plans offered by insurance companies through what is termed a medicare exchange but the congressional budget office raised significant questions about whether the premium payment would be adequate over time the cbo analysis estimated that by 2030 the government would pay just 32 percent of the health care costs less than half of what the federal plan currently pays the other 68 percent of the plan would have to be shouldered by the retiree ironically democrats successfully attacked the plan as ending “medicare as we know it” send us facts to check by filling out this form

response trump denied the allegations and during a rally in october 2016 suggested that leeds wasnt attractive enough for him to assault people that are willing to say oh i was with donald trump in 1980 i was sitting with him on an airplane and he went after me trump said believe me she would not be my first choice ivana trump donald trump and his former wife ivana pose outside the federal

clothes and yanking out a chunk of her hair then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than 16 months ivana is terrified … it is a violent assault harry hurt iii who obtained a copy of the deposition wrote in a 1993 book about trump according to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes he raped me ivana later slightly altered her allegation saying that while she

differently toward me than he had during our marriage ivana wrote in a 1993 statement as a woman i felt violated as the love and tenderness which he normally exhibited towards me was absent i referred to this as a rape but i do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense ivana is mother to donald jr eric and ivanka trump trumps response trump called hurts description of ivanas allegation obviously false in 1993 according to newsday trumps lawyer michael cohen argued in 2015 that his client could not have raped ivana because you cannot rape your spouse theres very clear case law he said cohen later recanted saying his comment was inarticulate kristin anderson screenshotwashington post allegations kristin anderson a photographer and former model said trump reached under her skirt and touched her vagina through her underwear at a new york city nightclub in the early 1990s anderson then in her early 20s said she wasnt talking with trump at the time and

vagina through my underwear absolutely and as i pushed the hand away and i got up and i turned around and i see these eyebrows very distinct eyebrows of donald trump she told the washington post in october 2016 anderson said she and her friends who were talking together around a table at the time of the incident were very grossed out and weirded out but thought okay donald is gross we all know hes gross lets just move on trumps response mr trump strongly denies this phony allegation by someone looking to get some free publicity hope hicks the presidents thenspokeswoman and current white house communications director told the post in october 2016 it is totally ridiculous jill harth screenshotinside edition allegations jill harth a businesswoman who worked with trump in the 1990s told

uphold his end of a business deal with harth and her thenpartner trumps response hicks responded to the times reporting denying harths allegations wholesale mr trump denies each and every statement made by ms harth she said lisa boyne screenshotbustle allegations lisa boyne a health food business entrepreneur told huffpost in october 2016 that she attended a 1996 dinner with trump and modeling

changing in their dressing rooms during the 1997 pageant i remember putting on my dress really quick because i was like oh my god theres a man in here mariah billado who represented vermont in 1997 told buzzfeed billado added that trump said something along the lines of dont worry ladies ive seen it all before victoria hughes a former miss new mexico said trump first introduced himself to the teenage contestants when he unexpectedly walked into their dressing room it was certainly the most inappropriate time to meet us all for the first time she told buzzfeed trumps response trump appeared

were unclothed ill go backstage before a show and everyones getting dressed and ready and everything else and you know no men are anywhere and im allowed to go in because im the owner of the pageant he said you know theyre standing there with no clothes and you see these incrediblelooking women and so i sort of get away with things like that in october 2016 the trump campaign called the allegations politically motivated lies these accusations have no merit and have already been disproven by many other individuals who were present the campaign said in a statement when you see questionable attacks like this magically put out there in the final month of a presidential campaign you have to ask yourself what the political motivations are and why the media is pushing it e jean

obtain any American’s tax returns to demand that the IRS turn them over.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/05/we-may-finally-see-trumps-tax-returns-republicans-are-panicking/,therecordcorrected,955,30,terrified of that prospect the administration is preparing to do everything in its power to keep it from happening as politico’s nancy cook reports ad the new house democratic majority is widely expected to test one of donald trump’s ultimate red lines by demanding the president’s personal tax returns — and the trump administration has been gearing up for months to fight back hard trumps treasury department is readying plans to drag the expected democratic request for trump’s past tax filings which he has closely guarded into a quagmire of arcane legal arguments at the same time officials intend to publicly cast the request as an nakedly partisan exercise the twopronged scheme was developed by a handful of top political appointees and lawyers inside the department — with the ultimate goal of keeping the president’s past returns private according to four people familiar with the administration’s approach legal experts make clear that the law is not ambiguous and the president can’t simply order the treasury department to keep his returns secret so the administration’s plan seems to be to wage a pr battle while keeping the matter slogging through the courts for as long as possible — say past november 2020 ad while trump’s refusal to release his returns — something nearly every majorparty nominee and president has done for the past halfcentury — has been controversial since 2016 once democrats demand the returns it will become an intense controversy playing out on television and the front pages of newspapers that means that republican officeholders will be forced to take a position which they haven’t really had to do before and they’ll be expected to defend the president’s refusal to allow the public to know where he’s getting money from whom he owes money to and how far his financial interests extend trump himself began in 2016 by saying he couldn’t release the returns since he was being audited this was a lie the irs doesn’t prevent you from releasing your returns if you’re being audited and it’s not as though you have to keep something secret from the irs since it already has the returns ad then once he took office the white house stopped bothering to offer a rationale at all responding to any question about the returns by saying that trump won so forget it “the white house response is that he’s not going to release his tax returns we litigated this all through the election people didn’t care they voted for him” said kellyanne conway just after trump took office and that has remained their position ever since ad so imagine youre a republican member of congress when this controversy becomes intense youre going to have to answer two questions the first is should trump release his returns if theyre going to be steadfastly loyal to trump — which is the most important principle the gop holds today — the answer theyll have to give is no the second question is why not and what will they say is there a reasonable answer to that question that you would be comfortable applying to any president of either party is any republican able to say with a straight face that its not in the public interest to know everything possible about the presidents financial dealings would they have had the same answer if hillary clinton had refused to release her returns ad there is a dodge that republicans can employ to those questions and its one i expect most of them will use thats up to the president im more concerned with the vital issues facing the american people in other words please dont make me defend trump ad but let’s be clear about one thing there has never before in american history been a president for whom it was more important that his tax returns be opened to scrutiny unlike previous presidents trump not only held on to his business interests after he took office he has made clear that he expects everyone from members of his party to foreign governments to put money in his pocket by patronizing those businesses he has an extraordinary record of creating grifts and swindles to separate the gullible and desperate from their money from trump university to the trump network to the trump institute his foundation was revealed to be essentially a scam and he was forced to shut it down ad perhaps most incredibly an extensively documented investigation revealed four months ago that trump and his family planned and executed an absolutely massive tax fraud scheme during the 1990s that defrauded the federal government of hundreds of millions of dollars were it not for the statute of limitations he would probably be facing prosecution for it ad the things in trumps past are appalling enough but its his current debts and business interests that we really need to understand trump himself obviously cant be relied on to inform us of any conflicts of interest he might have just look at how often he lied about russia claiming to have no business interests there when in fact during the campaign he was pursuing a deal to build a trump tower in moscow that could have netted him hundreds of millions of dollars republicans are as aware of all this as democrats are they know who the president is if they actually believed that trumps returns would show him to be a man of unimpeachable integrity who had committed no wrongdoing theyd be perfectly happy to have the public see them but we all know thats not what the returns will show ad so they shouldn’t be allowed to get away with saying it isn’t really their concern when we have a president as corrupt as this one it’s all of our concern and we need to find out exactly what he has been up to ad read more

young jews occupied ice detention centers and shut them down’” adlerstein 25 told nbc news people responded and by that evening on june 24 she was on the phone with other young jews from around the country planning a protest and hundreds of people had signed up on a google doc expressing interest in joining adlerstein is not new to activism she’s an organizer with movimiento cosecha which works to secure better conditions for immigrants as she watched pundits and politicians debate whether to call migrant detention centers “concentration camps” she was reminded of the holocaust refrain she was raised on “never again” “never again” she thought is now a week later on sunday june 30 about 200 protesters under the banner of the newly formed never again action protested outside a detention center in elizabeth new jersey thirtysix people were arrested that day and the demonstration had sparked a burgeoning movement “my intent wasn’t to start an organization or a longterm movement”

holocaust memorial where they marched to a nearby jail where ice houses detainees in philadelphia 33 people were arrested when they blocked the city’s fourth of july parade holding sings like ‘never

from nonprofits or political groups using gofundme the group was able to amass over 180000 in just over a week to support the legal fees of those arrested at the actions the group’s organizers are mostly young jews staying up late taking time off work and using their free time to plan the string of protest they said they are getting practical advice from movimiento cosecha like making sure they aren’t blocking access to detention centers during visitation hours and crowdsourcing skills from people who want to help and know what it takes to plan large protests migrant detention centers have come under scrutiny amid reports of overcrowding and mistreatment conditions were so bad at one texas facility that following media reports nearly 300 children were removed after it was reported they had no access to showers for extended periods of time insufficient food and were lacking in other basic necessities on friday vice president mike pence saw the conditions never again action is protesting when he visited two federal detention centers in texas a group of men detained behind a chain link fence were captured on video some seen lying on mats covered with silver mylar emergency blankets while others chanted “no shower no shower” to the news cameras as the vice president walked through the facility pence called media reports of the mistreatment of migrants “slanderous” and said he was “impressed” with customs and border protection’s “compassionate work” on june 17 rep alexandria ocasiocortez dny referred to the centers as “concentration camps” which led many mainstream jewish organization to make statements criticizing her while politicians on both aisles also condemned her language but some jews stood by her comments sophie hurwitz 20 a wellesley college student who was arrested at the elizabeth protest said she also calls the detention centers “concentration camps” but doesn’t think that’s the most important part of the conversation “now is not the time for semantics” she said “now is the time for making sure people are safe and we have so much work to do” hurwitz said she felt like she had to put her “body on the line” which is how she wound up at the

treatment of migrants and refugees “our history of trauma is being exploited to further a rightwing political agenda” she said giskin who works as a community organizer in philadelphia said being jewish informs her activism citing the jewish community’s deep ties to social justice movements she joined never again action to “see some of that fire back in the streets” she hopes as the movement grows it will “awaken” other jews and serve as a “reminder of what our history means and the role we can play in fighting for a better world” while its the young jews who are on the frontlines the protests have drawn diverse support within the jewish community⁠ — parents are bringing their children rabbis are attending and yeshiva students have also turned out “the elizabeth action had everyone from nonreligious jews tattooed all over with a bunch of piercings to people with tefillin and a kippah on” hurwitz said organizers are hoping the movement will be inclusive and stay focused on the issues at hand “there are probably people there who dont agree on my stance on israel and palestine but we agree on this” giskin said “the goal is to build this movement it’s strategic not to get into every issue” julia davidovitz 25 a preschool teacher in boston organizing with never again said people like her need to act and bring the community together because institutional leaders aren’t this is an occasion where we have been moral leaders” she said “we have not seen as much moral leadership from the stronghold of the mainstream jewish leadership” her message “join us” davidovitz wants to see entire congregations join upcoming actions and invited her rabbi and mom to join her in action “this is a crisis no matter what language you use to describe it” davidovitz said “we are a community

“us wealth concentration seems to have returned to levels last seen during the roaring twenties” that shift is eroding security from families in the lower and middle classes who rely on their small stores of wealth to finance their retirement and to smooth over economic shocks like the loss of a job and it’s consolidating power in the hands of the nation’s billionaires who are increasingly using their riches to purchase political influence ad ad zucman who advised sen elizabeth warren dmass on a recent proposal to tax high levels of wealth warns that these numbers may understate the amount of wealth concentrated in the hands of the rich it has become more difficult to account for the true wealth of the ultrarich in recent decades in part because many hide their assets in offshore tax shelters wealth here is roughly synonymous with net worth the value of everything that a family owns minus the value of any debt assets such as homes land rental properties stock holdings business equity and bank accounts are included the definition excludes personal possessions like cars and furniture they’re difficult to measure don’t produce income and would amount to a tiny fraction of the nation’s net worth if they were included according to zucman for illustrative purposes consider a person who owns a 250000 house with 200000 in outstanding mortgage debt she also has 5000 in her bank account and 25000 in a 401k that person has a net worth of 80000 a figure derived from the sum of all her assets 250000 5000 25000 minus the sum of all her debts 200000 that 80000 puts her close to the national median of household net worth according to previous research by edward n wolff of new york university american wealth is highly unevenly distributed much more so than income according to zucman’s latest calculations today the top 01 percent of the population has captured nearly 20 percent of the nation’s wealth giving them a greater slice of the american pie than the bottom 80 percent of the population combined that bottom 80 percent figure includes the 1 in 5 american households that has either zero or negative wealth meaning that its debts are greater than or equal to its assets according to nyu’s wolff the share of us households with zero or negative wealth has risen by roughly onethird since 1983 when it was 155 percent the top 10 percent of individuals meanwhile own more than 70 percent of the nation’s wealth more than twice the amount owned by the bottom 90 percent the top 10 percent have increased their share of wealth by about 10 percentage points since the early 1980s with a concomitant decline in the share of wealth owned by everyone else in some ways zucman finds the distribution of wealth in the united states more closely resembles the situation in russia and china than in other advanced democracies such as the united kingdom and france several caveats to this discussion are in order first a person with negative net worth is not necessarily penniless a number of the households in the negativenetworth bucket may be young professionals like doctors or lawyers starting off their careers with large amounts of student debt this is not necessarily a problem if their high earnings ultimately erase their debt and catapult them into the upper reaches of the wealth spectrum later in their careers ad ad but young highearning professionals account for a minority of negativenetworth families the 2016 survey of consumer finances for instance shows that about 40 percent of families in the bottom quartile of net worth had an outstanding student loan balance of any kind highearning professionals probably account for just a fraction of that 40 percent second rising wealth inequality may not necessarily be a zerosum game the rich gobbling up a larger share of the national wealth pie may not be a problem if there’s still more pie left for everyone else relative to several years or decades ago there’s good reason to suspect that this may be the case for income while incomes at the top have risen dramatically over the past few decades incomes in the middle have risen too albeit much more slowly but the same dynamic is not occurring with household wealth according to wolff the median household wealth in the united states in 2016 78100 was slightly lower in inflationadjusted dollars than it was three decades ago in 1983 80000 over the same time period the average wealth of the top 1 percent of households more than doubled from 106 million to 264 million ad ad the wealthy are becoming wealthier in other words and there’s good reason to think it’s happening at the expense of everyone else as zucman notes this has very different implications for different groups of people “for everybody except the rich” he writes wealth’s “main function is to provide security” middleclass families tend to use their wealth to save for rainyday expenses or to draw down on for retirement

anxiety of trump supporters is often touted as the driving force behind the mogul’s electoral college victory that rationale is just a ruse a clever red herring the median income of a trump supporter is more than 70000 per year which is well above the national average and a 2016 study noted that it would take african americans 228 years to equal the wealth of whites in the us clearly trump’s pathway into the oval office is not really about white economic angst rather barack obama’s election — and its powerful symbolism of black advancement — was the major trigger for the policy backlash that led to donald trump and which has now put america’s national security at risk republicans carved out this trench shortly after obama’s 2008 victory the gop pushed through a number of laws at the state level to block as many of his voters primarily african americans from the polls as possible north carolina targeted black voters with nearly “surgical precision” wisconsin republicans were “giddy” about disfranchising african americans especially in milwaukee florida’s gop cut particular days of early voting to nullify the political participation of black churchgoers texas required certain types of governmentissued photo ids to vote and then ensured that nearly 16 million black and latino citizens would have very limited access ohio skewed its early voting laws to diminish the turnout in the cities while also implementing a literacy test that officials applied only to those in urban counties the end result was that the republicans had effectively shattered the black and latino demographic firewall that could have prevented a trump presidency a trump presidency to be clear that many in the republican establishment rightfully feared because of the mogul’s demonstrated unfitness for office but they didn’t fear it enough because even in the wake of federal court orders striking down many of the most odious discriminatory features of voter suppression the gop resisted stalled and defied the judiciary until confusion and resignation reigned at the polls it was too late in a horrific faustian calculation these republican patriots put the nation at risk so that trump could fulfill his dominant campaign promise and to be clear it was not to make america great again but to make access to america’s resources “whites only” again the klan recognized it as did the white nationalists who gave trump their fullthrottled support but this wasn’t just a fantasy of the far right the allure of a revived jim crow nation that proudly willfully excludes and debases millions of nonwhites was so reaffirming and reassuring that everything else became secondary or tertiary everything else including national security despite his glaring lack of qualifications patriots shoved trump into the role of commander in chief — a man who had already maligned the us military as a “disaster” denigrated the generals dismantling isis and disparaged pows for being stupid enough to get caught patriots cheered on as trump asked the russian government to hack an american citizen who had led a nationalsecurity agency patriots acquiesced to a foreign policy that encouraged nuclear proliferation oozed profound ignorance about the basic fundamentals of us nuclear capability and kept in play use of the ultimate weapon by a man who has difficulty even maintaining control on twitter patriots gleefully ignored warnings by the national security agency that the hacked documents released by wikileaks were actually the result of and washed through russian intelligence patriots didn’t blink when trump’s economic plan included the possibility of defaulting on the us debt although that “could undermine the stability of global financial markets” on a scale not seen since the great recession and cost american taxpayers billions of dollars in higher interest rates patriots accepted trump’s admiration of vladimir putin disdain for the president of the united states and a foreign policy agenda that matched up smoothly with the russian — not american — government’s in other words in january 2017 a man will be at the helm of the us military intelligence and foreign policy bureaucracies who actually encouraged foreign intervention in an american election and advocated for dismantling the alliances that will aid russian expansionism and weaken us influence and power yet

periodic interviewsturnedairingofgrievances when the conversation turned to the 2020 election trump singled out what he called the “biggest risk” to his bid for a second term it was not the mounting death toll from covid19 or further economic damage inflicted by the pandemic or anything else a realitydwelling president might fret about “my biggest risk is that we don’t win lawsuits” trump told the politico reporter he’d invited he was referring to the series of lawsuits filed by his campaign and the republican national committee that fight the expansion of mailin voting and seek to limit access to the ballot box in november “we have many lawsuits going all over” he said “and if we don’t win those lawsuits i think — i think it puts the election at risk” going into 2020 trump had the

strategy has come into clear unmistakable focus trump and his republican enablers are putting voter suppression front and center — fearmongering about voting by mail escalating their election day poll watching and socalled ballotsecurity operations and blocking funding to prepare the country for a pandemicera election “the president views votebymail as a threat to his election” a lawyer for the trump campaign recently told 60 minutes attorney general william barr told fox news that votebymail “absolutely opens the floodgates to fraud” and trump blasted out in a may tweet that “mailin voting will lead to massive fraud and abuse it will also lead to the end of our great republican party we can never let this tragedy befall our nation” “they’re shouting the quiet part out loud” marc elias one of the democratic party’s top election lawyers tells rolling stone “they’re not whispering it they’re shouting it” justin clark a senior lawyer on the trump 2020 campaign had a message for the group of republican lawyers gathered at a membersonly club in madison wisconsin last november every time he met with president trump clark told the group trump asked “‘what are we doing about voter fraud what are we doing about voter fraud’” “traditionally it’s always been republicans suppressing votes in places” clark said he would later explain that he was referring to what democrats say about republicans but it was all part of a larger point — namely to ensure the president’s election the trump campaign and rnc were stepping up their efforts to root out the supposed scourge of “voter fraud” “it’s going to be a much bigger program much more aggressive program a better funded program” said clark the president he assured the group “believes in it and he will do whatever it takes to make sure it’s successful” to be clear rampant voter fraud is a myth a fantasy dreamed up by those who need a pretext to make it harder for certain people to exercise their right to vote instances of inperson and mailin voter fraud are extremely rare according to decades of data and academic research the conservative heritage foundation — whose cofounder paul weyrich once told a group of evangelical leaders that “i don’t want everybody to vote” because “our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down” — is one of the loudest proponents of the voterfraud myth yet according to heritage’s own research in the past 20 years 000006 percent of all mailin ballots cast were fraudulent “there is no support for the argument that mailin voting is a problem” says lorraine minnite a politicalscience professor at rutgers university and author of the myth of voter fraud but that isn’t stopping trump and the republican party from going on the offensive trump officials argue that democrats are using covid19 as an “excuse and pretext” to rush through drastic changes like universal votebymail that are intended to benefit their candidates and that would inject more uncertainty into our elections “president trump will not stand by as democrats attempt to tear apart our entire election system just months before votes are cast” clark the trump campaign lawyer said in a statement to rolling stone in february the trump campaign and the republican national committee announced that they would spend 10 million on votingrelated lawsuits in 2020 — a figure that has since doubled to 20 million the rnc has so far filed lawsuits in more than a dozen states including the battlegrounds of colorado minnesota michigan wisconsin pennsylvania and florida these suits are a mix of offense and defense some attempt to block litigation brought by democratic groups to expand mailin voting in response to the coronavirus pandemic others seek to invalidate statelevel policies by saying that expanding access to mailin ballots invites fraud but the uniting theme of the rnc’s suits says rick hasen a university of california irvine law professor and author of election meltdown is simple “casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election raising spurious fraud claims” in pennsylvania for instance the rnc is suing the state government and election boards in all 67 counties to ban the use of secure drop boxes for submitting takehome ballots and to eliminate the requirement that poll watchers can only serve in the county where they live in florida republicans have sued to block efforts that would make the state pay for postage on mailin ballots would change state law so that any mailin ballot postmarked by the date of the election as opposed to received by election day will be counted and would allow paid organizers to gather and submit completed absentee ballots it’s a sign of how aggressive and deeppocketed the gop legal strategy is that the party is waging legal battles in states that trump has no chance of winning in may the rnc and two other groups sued california gov gavin newsom a democrat over a newly announced plan to mail absentee ballots to all eligible voters in the nation’s most populous state “that would be like me waking up one day and saying ‘i’m going to file a votingrights lawsuit in’ — i don’t even know what the equivalent is — ‘wyoming or south dakota’ ” says elias the democratic party election lawyer the rnc’s suit against california “suggests to me that their 20 million is only a small tip of the iceberg” he adds the funders of the rnc’s 2020 legal war chest are a who’s who of plutocrats and industry titans for whom a 100000 check to the president is pocket change according to an analysis of election records by rolling stone these funders include ll bean heiress linda bean privateequity magnate stephen schwarzman johnson johnson heir ambassador woody johnson sen kelly loeffler rga the ricketts family that founded td ameritrade coal barons joe craft and robert murray billionaire financiers john paulson and john w childs financial executive charles schwab madison square garden owner james dolan and marvel entertainment chairman ike perlmutter “it’s no surprise to see that the list of wealthy people bankrolling the rnc’s attack on voting rights includes some of the biggest benefactors of the trump administration’s economic policy” says morris pearl chair of patriotic millionaires “they don’t want to protect our elections — they want to protect their positions of privilege” the trump campaign has a deeppocketed ally in its attack on mailin voting the honest elections project funded by undisclosed dark money and linked to leonard leo the conservative activist who helped put justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh on the supreme court and steered more than 250 million for conservative judicial causes between 2014 and 2017 the organization says on its website that voter suppression is a “myth” the group has run ads that warn against “risky new methods” like mailin ballots and accused wisconsin democrats of sowing election “chaos” after the state’s republicans refused to send every voter an absentee ballot or delay its april primary election because of covid19 the group has hired the same law firm spearheading the rnc’s massive litigation campaign consovoy mccarthy to pressure election officials in battleground states to purge their voting rolls threatening to sue them if they don’t comply the group’s executive director jason snead is a former heritage foundation scholar who has argued that felons “should be required to prove that they have turned over a new leaf” before they can vote again and that “fraudulent” voting behavior is “deeply ingrained in certain regions of the country” earlier this year snead told breitbart news that the “greatest danger” facing american elections amid the covid19 crisis wasn’t the risk of illness or death but democratic proposals for reforming the voting process to meet our pandemic moment snead did not respond to a request for comment votingrights activists say snead’s comments are typical of a conservative movement that wants to make it harder for people of color exfelons and college students to vote lauren grohwargo ceo of fair fight action founded by former georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams and funded by major liberal donors says snead is “directly dogwhistling around this racist idea that there are these droves of illegal voters which is not true” illustration by victor juhasz for rolling stone on november 3rd 1981 lynette monroe who lived in northwest trenton headed out to her polling place it was election day in new jersey when monroe a democrat arrived at the polling site she was stopped outside by a member of a group called the national ballot security task force monroe was asked if she had her voterregistration card with her she said she did not but that it didn’t matter — she was a registered voter but the national ballot security task force members “turned her away preventing her from casting her ballot” according to a lawsuit later filed by the democratic party monroe and several others when she was turned away monroe had no way of knowing that the national ballot security task force was a massive votersuppression project funded and carried out by the republican national committee and the new jersey republican party republicans hired county deputy sheriffs and local policemen with revolvers twoway radios and “national ballot security task force” armbands to patrol predominantly black and hispanic precincts in new jersey they posted large warning signs outside polling places saying that it was “a crime to falsify a ballot or to violate election laws” the signs omitted any mention of the gop’s role in this egregious intimidation scheme but the intent was obvious “to harass and intimidate duly qualified black and hispanic voters for the purpose and with the effect of discouraging these voters from casting their ballots” the lawsuit stated the result of the suit was a 1982 consent decree between the democratic and republican parties even though the rnc refused to admit wrongdoing in new jersey the group agreed to stop harassing and intimidating voters of color including by deputizing offduty lawenforcement officers and equipping those officers with guns or badges over the next three decades democrats marshaled enough evidence of ongoing republican voter suppression to maintain the consent decree until 2018 when a federal judge lifted the order the 2020 presidential election will be the first in nearly 40 years when the rnc isn’t bound by the terms of the 1982 decree clark the trump campaign lawyer told the group of republicans at the private meeting last november that the end of the consent decree was “a huge huge huge huge deal” freeing the rnc to directly coordinate with campaigns and political committees on socalled election day operations the rnc is sending millions of dollars to state republican parties to vastly expand these measures which include recruiting 50000 poll observers to deploy in key precincts josh helton a lawyer who has advised the national republican senatorial committee has described philadelphia where black people make up 41 percent of the population as “probably the epicenter for voter fraud in this country” and a likely target for the gop’s 2020 pollwatching efforts depending on the state poll watchers enlisted by political parties can challenge a voter’s eligibility based on their address citizenship and even the date they registered to vote michigan law for instance says poll watchers need only “good reason” to pull a prospective voter out of line and challenge their eligibility north carolina allows anyone registered to vote with “good moral character” whatever that means to work as a poll watcher even in oregon and washington state where elections are conducted by mail poll watchers can observe county clerks count mailin ballots and make challenges when they see fit here again outside groups seem to be drafting off of the trump campaign’s aggressive plans catherine engelbrecht founder of true the vote a group that spreads misinformation about “voter fraud” and has accused “globalists” of exploiting the covid19 pandemic to “finance a massive push to ‘vote at home’” laid out at a closeddoor conference in february a plan to enlist navy seals to monitor polling places in 2020 “you get some seals in those polls and they’re going to say ‘no no this is what it says this is how we’re going to play this show’” engelbrecht said according to a recording obtained by the intercept “that’s what we need we need people who are unafraid to call it like they see it” to votingrights advocates the rnc and true the vote’s pollwatching plans if realized are nothing more than a blatant voterintimidation strategy “their program is based on a false premise that americans and especially americans of color are breaking the law when it comes to voting so their poll monitors become de facto policemen and serve no purpose but to intimidate voters because fraud is so rare” says grohwargo of fair fight action “they’re aiming to pack monitors into polling places to disrupt voting from within but they’re also hoping that the existence of their massive program creates an aura of intimidation that deters eligible voters from participating in the first place” just as racism and xenophobia have always been essential to trump’s political dna so too have nonstop evidencefree claims of “voter fraud” and “rigged” elections even after he defeated hillary clinton in 2016 he claimed — with zero evidence — that 3 to 5 million noncitizens had voted and that was why he lost the popular vote thus surely becoming the first presidential victor to allege historic levels of “illegal” voting … in the election he just won now with covid19 ravaging the country and disproportionately afflicting people of color trump has found a way to attack the democratic process that combines his stephen millerinspired racist agenda and his deranged voterfraud obsession votebymail didn’t used to be a partisan idea before covid19 five states led by democrats and republicans alike conducted their elections entirely by mail — colorado hawaii oregon washington and utah — and 29 more states plus dc permitted “no excuse” absentee voting meaning voters can request absentee ballots without having to provide any reason why us service members have long mailed in their ballots from overseas and until recently both political parties have touted its benefits but suddenly republican elected officials from trump on down to local lawmakers are blocking efforts to make it easier to vote by mail consider iowa in response to the pandemic secretary of state paul pate a republican extended early voting and sent an absentee ballot application to every voter turnout in the state’s june primary elections surged and the vast majority of people voted absentee iowa republican legislators responded by hastily passing a law to limit the secretary of state’s emergency authority “mailin voting wasn’t created in this pandemic” says janai nelson associate directorcounsel at the naacp legal defense and educational fund “it’s only when we see the expansion of access to this very practical tool that we see the casting of votes being subjected to such scrutiny and malignment” the naked hypocrisy of the republican party’s newfound antipathy toward mailin voting is all the more glaring considering that trump vice president mike pence ag barr and many other senior trump administration officials have voted absentee repeatedly in the past and as an actual strategy trump’s attacks on mailin voting could even turn out to be selfdestructive if you account for the fact that republican voters have long been avid users of mailin voting in florida absentee voting is widely popular among the state’s republican voters in arizona where the republican presidential candidate has won every four years since 1972 with only one exception the gop initiated and perfected the use of mailin voting chuck coughlin a consultant who advised sen john mccain calls it “a very effective way of letting people participate” with few incidents of fraud the real threat to the 2020 elections is not what trump barr and their allies want you to believe it’s the funding and readiness crisis facing thousands of election jurisdictions trying to shift to a hybrid inpersonvotebymail model in a few months’ time in california where 72 percent of voters mailed in their ballots in the most recent primary the transition won’t be as hard but pennsylvania where the percentage of mailin ballots is in the single digits faces a daunting task coughlin the arizona consultant says it took years and many elections for arizona to master the use of widely adopted mailin voting underfunded election operations are a perennial issue but with state budgets facing dramatic cutbacks due to covid19 the funding shortfall could be worse than ever “my usual electioncycle comment is that we’re trying to find enough duct tape to cover the holes in the bucket” says justin levitt a professor at loyola law school and votingrights expert “this time we’re trying to make the bucket out of duct tape” civilrights groups have asked congress to approve 4 billion as soon as possible for election funding so far trump has signed off on just 400 million onetenth of the recommended amount and local officials have already spent most of that initial money house democrats included that funding in a coronavirus relief bill the heroes act but senate republicans led by mitch mcconnell blocked the bill and trump called it “dead on arrival” how to explain this it’s possible that voter suppression isn’t the only goal — it’s also about creating chaos and confusion before on and after election day perhaps trump’s assault on voting in our pandemic election year isn’t a “strategy” at all but rather a kamikaze mission aimed at the heart of american democracy the way coughlin sees it the ultimate goal of trump’s criticism of mailin voting is “to sow doubt in people’s minds about the process which validates any view of his unless he wins” by beating the drum about “massive fraud and abuse” and spreading misinformation about the integrity of the election trump could be laying the groundwork to challenge or outright deny the results and if the rnc were to follow his lead and file lawsuits challenging the vote count we could wind up in dangerously uncharted territory for american democracy picture bush v gore on steroids “we’ve never had a president delegitimize our democratic process intentionally” says rachel bitecofer a senior fellow and election forecaster at the niskanen center “it is the kind of behavior you would not see — and should not see — in a healthy democracy”

gkwgpg,2020-05-16 18:27:34,Democrats,U.S. jobless rate has already broken Great Depression records — and most media missed it,https://www.salon.com/2020/05/15/us-jobless-rate-has-already-broken-great-depression-records--and-most-media-missed-it_partner/,1000000students,933,19,the bureau of labor statistics eagerly awaited friday morning official unemployment rate report for april — what editors generally call the bls headline rate of unemployment — was definitely headlineworthy this was especially evident in the next days new york times 5920 which ran a bar chart of historic unemployment going back to 1946 across the top of the front page and then a long red bar down the righthand column of the entire page showing job losses for april advertisement the new york times 5920 featured a chart of job losses that stretched all the way down the front page it was a dramatic illustration of how the bottom had fallen out of the job market with 205 million new jobless workers bringing the unemployment rate to 147 — the highest that number has been since the end of the 1930s but the blaring headlines should actually have been considerably worse perhaps with that red bar running off the bottom of the times front page ignored by nearly all us news organizations at least initially was an explanation made by the bls at the end of its press release on the april layoffs explaining that the official u3 unemployment rate which is supposed to measure jobless people actively looking for work was actually incorrect in a boxed 572word addendum appended to its press release and referenced in a note at the top of the release was the following explanation advertisement there was also a large increase in the number of workers who were classified as employed but absent from work as was the case in march special instructions sent to the household survey interviewers called for all employed persons absent from work due to coronavirusrelated business closures to be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff however it is apparent that not all such workers were so classified if the workers who were recorded as employed but absent from work due to other reasons over and above the number absent for other reasons in a typical april had been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff the overall unemployment rate would have been almost 5 percentage points higher than reported on a notseasonally adjusted basis however according to usual practice the data from the household survey are accepted as recorded to maintain data integrity no ad hoc actions are taken to reclassify survey responses theres a lot of gobbledygook in there but the upshot is that if reporters and news editors had read the note they should have reported the bls headline unemployment rate as approximately 197 not 147 as the bls wrote in its note if the error in classifying some laidoff workers in the survey had been corrected the rate would have been the higher figure that correction puts the real u3 number in the range of unemployment rates that were being reported during the mid1930s in the depths of the great depression the significance of this poor reporting was that the stock market — that supposedly great gauge of economic sentiment — popped up the nasdaq by 158 the sp by 168 and the dow jones by 191 on the news that the unemployment jump was significantly lower than the 16 that many analysts had been predicting in reality though the corrected rate of 197 blasted way past that prediction if accurately reported it would likely have caused the markets to tank before the weekend instead of rising if past history is any guide advertisement the initial news reports about the bls 830 am news release were almost universally wrong in their headlines and most didnt bother reporting on the blss note with its 5 correction for cnbc 5820 a key point was that economists had been expecting…the unemployment rate to surge to 16 the headline of fridays cnbc article 5820 read a record 205 million jobs were lost in april as unemployment rate jumps to 147 filed at 830 am and updated at 1127 am cnbc went with the disavowed official number reporter jeff cox in his revised article at least added the bls comment that some people were erroneously not included as being unemployed but like most reporters covering this story he appears to have confused that problem with the routine way that the bls underreports unemployment advertisement a more encompassing measure that includes those not looking for work as well as those holding parttime jobs for economic reasons also hit an alltime high of 228 that reading may be a more accurate picture of the current jobs situation as millions of workers are being paid to stay home and thus not willing or able to look for new jobs the problem is that cox is referring to a different bls unemployment statistic figure the socalled u6 rate which includes discouraged workers and people working parttime who want fulltime employment since investors know all about that rate which is also reported by the bls every month and know it is always significantly higher than the u3 rate it is automatically discounted by them in fact if both the error cited by the bls itself and the u6 additions to the tally of unemployed were combined and added to the 147 official u3 unemployment rate for april the unemployment rate as of april 16 would have been 278 which would be higher than the record great depression unemployment rate of 249 notched in 1933 cnn 5820 in its main report on the bls friday morning announcement stuck with the 147 unemployment figure and didnt mention the correction in the box following the bureaus release a subsequent cnn feature 5820 did explain that the unemployment rate would be even higher if involuntary parttimers and people who want jobs but are no longer looking for work were included advertisement the new york times 5820 ran with the bls official unemployment rate in its headline and in its dramatic chart saying the jobs numbers were the catastrophe everybody was expecting the article that followed then referred to the 147 figure well down into the story the paper stated whats more because of issues with the way workers are classified the actual unemployment employment rate might have been more close to 20 this was a fudge the article should have reported that the bls explained that there had been an error in how millions of workers had been classified and that if corrected that rate would have been not might have been close to 20 advertisement the wall street journal 5820 headlined the 147 figure but noted that if senthome workers had been appropriately counted as being temporarily laid off the unemployment rate would have been almost 5 percentage points higher the wall street journal 5820 which typically does more accurate reporting on unemployment figures also went with the official 147 bls number in its headline april unemployment rate rose to a record 147 this article like others initially ignored the crucial correction in a later revision the paper did add that the bls survey showed a large number of workers who said they were employed but absent from work and wrote that many of those should have been counted as a temporary layoff which would have caused the unemployment rate to be almost 5 percentage points higher but the revised version failed to note that the bls itself admitted it was a mistake left uncorrected in deference to its tradition of not altering gathered data once collected left unsaid was why the journal didnt report the number correctly as 197 yahoo news 5820 stood out for getting the story right while the article carried the same kind of misleading headline — april jobs report us employers cut a record 205 million payrolls unemployment rate jumps to 147 — reporter emily mccormick helpfully included a line saying the jobless rate would have been nearly 5 percentage points higher if workers were classified differently during the survey data collection the bls added in a note after that she included the full explanation from the actual bls addendum to its press release its hard to understand why reporters and editors would have missed an opportunity for a banner headline saying that the unemployment rate in this stunning pandemic recession had already leapt to or perhaps beyond a great depression level perhaps in todays era of newsroom cutbacks and with a race to get the story out first when a government agency embargoes information until a sudden 830 am release these washington reporters for the most part didnt take the time to read the bls box explaining the error that it had deliberately not corrected advertisement oh well since the april bls report was through april 16 and missed the 7 million more workers laid off in the second two weeks of the month plus a likely equal amount wholl be sacked in the first two weeks of may theyll get another chance for that screaming headline
ex7k9o,2020-02-01 17:20:59,Democrats,New Bolton revelations show Trump’s trial is more corrupt than we thought,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/31/new-bolton-revelations-show-trumps-trial-is-more-corrupt-than-we-thought/,Maddoktor2,931,39,more than two months before he asked ukraine’s president to investigate his political opponents president trump directed john r bolton then his national security adviser to help with his pressure campaign to extract damaging information on democrats from ukrainian officials according to an unpublished manuscript by mr bolton mr trump gave the instruction mr bolton wrote during an oval office conversation in early may that included the acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney the president’s personal lawyer rudolph w giuliani and the white house counsel pat a cipollone who is now leading the president’s impeachment defense mr trump told mr bolton to call volodymyr zelensky who had recently won election as president of ukraine to ensure mr zelensky would meet with mr giuliani who was planning a trip to ukraine to discuss the investigations that the president sought in mr bolton’s account mr bolton never made the call he wrote first this shows that trump’s chief counsel for his impeachment defense pat cipollone might have been a fact witness to the very corrupt scheme for which trump was impeached — and for which the senate is now set to acquit him ad stephen gillers a professor at the new york university school of law told us that this raises serious questions about the propriety of cipollone’s role as trump’s chief counsel as gillers wrote in a recent piece cipollone had an obligation at a minimum to disclose all his own knowledge of the facts surrounding the case as gillers wrote a legal ethics rule known as the “advocatewitness rule” says that “when a lawyer should be a witness at trial she cannot also be an advocate in the courtroom ad now bolton has placed cipollone right in the room with trump as he ordered bolton to pressure the ukrainian president to work with trump’s personal lawyer to set up a shadow operation that would subvert our foreign policy and national interest to trump’s corrupt political ends ad “in a real trial when we’re looking to discover the truth if you should be a witness because of what you know you cannot be the lawyer” gillers told us adding that “in a real trial” prosecutors could “ask the judge to order cipollone to disclose his participation in the underlying events” the parallels between a real trial and an impeachment trial are of course imperfect gillers noted but the house impeachment managers could try something similar right now what democrats can do gillers suggested that the house impeachment managers could ask the presiding officer chief justice john g roberts jr to remove cipollone as trump’s chief counsel and order cipollone to sit for questioning by the managers as part of trump’s trial ad ad “the managers might ask the chief justice to require cipollone to testify under oath subject to crossexamination” gillers said “there’s a very plausible argument to say that he should have been a fact witness gillers noted that roberts — who has been reluctant to involve himself in the proceedings — might decline to rule on the question which would then presumably punt it over to the senate itself to decide gillers said the managers could ask roberts to at least delay the proceedings to allow that vote which would be interesting because at that point senate republicans would almost certainly vote down such a request and that would once again show their rocksolid dedication to corrupting the trial in service of helping trump avoid a full reckoning in this sordid affair ad what’s more the new bolton revelations show that the trial has been even more corrupted by trump and his team than we thought in another important way ad the gop senate just officially voted down any new witnesses and evidence at trump’s trial this means we will not only be denied what bolton knows at least in the context of the trial we will also be denied bolton’s testimony about the role played by trump’s own chief counsel to be clear we don’t know if what bolton is saying about cipollone is true but importantly gop senators are not allowing bolton to testify and are thus sidestepping their responsibility to evaluate his claims on their own ad which means gop senators will now vote to acquit trump after voting to put into effect trump’s own decree that they cannot hear any new witnesses and evidence — including new evidence about the highly dubious role in the saga allegedly played by trump’s chief counsel meanwhile the new revelations raise fresh questions about how involved acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney was in the scheme ad mulvaney has said he would leave the room when trump was talking to giuliani to preserve their attorneyclient privilege even though attorneyclient privilege only applies to legal advice an attorney gives a client and that’s not what giuliani was doing but according to bolton mulvaney was involved from the very beginning in the effort to pressure the ukrainians ad as ambassador gordon sondland famously testified everyone was in the loop mulvaney of course has also been blocked from testifying — first to the house and now to the senate with the complicity of republicans who have actively chosen to deny themselves the opportunity to hear from mulvaney another direct witness to trump’s misconduct finally the new revelations also make clear that the more congress or anyone else investigates this matter the more facts will emerge ad this underscores again the profound corruption driving the senate gop’s refusal to hear new witnesses and evidence every passing day brings new revelations that make their preordained acquittal vote

fxqy1o,2020-04-09 14:41:38,Democrats,"Dr. Lance Dodes on Trump: A ""predator"" who ""would be in prison"" if he hadn't been born rich",https://www.salon.com/2020/04/09/dr-lance-dodes-trump-is-a-predator-and-if-he-werent-president-he-would-be-in-prison/,ravenmarie666,931,39,most people find donald trump bewildering his lies cruelty corruption greed delusions of godlike power and other unconscionable behavior seem unbelievable if trump were a character in a tv show movie or comic book the audience would laugh at his clumsy obvious villainy the whole story would be rejected as horrendously bad writing and a waste of time but trump is not that in fact complicated or puzzling once his core motivations are understood and then accepted as basic facts he appears to be a sociopath as such he lacks human empathy and a capacity for the norms of healthy human social relationships in so many ways donald trump is like a space alien who came to earth and is badly impersonating a human being advertisement the coronavirus pandemic and trumps cruel and callous reactions to it have only served to amplify his gross defects in personality behavior and values writing at the guardian lloyd green summarizes donald trumps emotional and cognitive defects as magnified by the coronavirus crisis on sunday initially at least there was no white house briefing on the presidents public schedule but the bad news kept coming coronavirus deaths continued to climb and reports of the heartland being unprepared for what may be on its horizon continued to ricochet around the media in the words of one administration insider to the guardian the trump organism is simply collapsing hes killing his own supporters members of the national guard emergency workers rankandfile americans all are exposed yet trump appears incapable of emoting anything that comes close to heartfelt concern or just providing straight answers in a recent oped for the new york times frank bruni speaks to the human emptiness and lack of care concern empathy and overall decency at the center of donald trump advertisement one more question do you remember the moment when president trumps bearing and words made clear that he grasped not only the magnitude of this rapidly metastasizing pandemic but also our terror in the face of it it passed me by maybe because it never happened in trumps predecessors for all their imperfections i could sense the beat of a heart and see the glimmer of a soul in him i cant and that fills me with a sorrow and a rage that i quite frankly dont know what to do with… and while im not looking to trump for any panacea is it too much to ask for some sign that the dying has made an impression on him that the crying has penetrated his carapace and that hes thinking about something other than his ratings i watch i wait i suspect ill be doing that forever i recently spoke with dr lance dodes a retired assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school and now a training and supervising analyst emeritus at the boston psychoanalytic society and institute we discussed the coronavirus pandemic and what this crisis has revealed about donald trumps mental health and behavior dodes was a contributor to the bestselling volume the dangerous case of donald trump 37 psychiatrists and mental health experts assess a president and is a regular guest on msnbcs the last word with lawrence odonnell in this conversation dodes explains how the coronavirus pandemic offers further evidence of trumps predatory sociopathic behavior and his lack of care or concern for other human beings trumps programming and behavior in fact makes him perhaps the worst person imaginable to lead the united states through the coronavirus crisis dodes also explains why too many people especially in the news media remain in a state of deep denial about trumps behavior and the depths of his mental pathologies advertisement if trump had not been born into money dodes told me he would have wound up in prison by now instead he is president of the united states and vigorously protected by the republican party and its supporters this conversation has been edited for clarity and length advertisement is donald trump the freest man alive he has no internal restraints — and increasingly no external restraints either i think he is the least free man you and i have some degree of choice about how were going to behave and react to the world around us we are complex and we make complex decisions because we have a conscience and we care about the effects of our actions on others donald trump in contrast is very simple everything he says or does is for himself either to have power over others or to hurt them in revenge against their disagreeing or standing in his way because he has shown himself to be incapable of either conscience or empathy he is basically a predator lacking the most essential parts of our humanity despite this he has two techniques that have allowed him to be successful in business and politics he is a bully and he lies continuously repeating his lies over and over is like the big lie technique made famous by hitler it works because when a lie is endlessly repeated even decent people assume there must be some truth in it advertisement donald trump has lied at least 16000 times why are there journalists reporters politicians and people among the general public who keep giving him the benefit of the doubt despite the overwhelming evidence that he is a compulsive liar people want to trust others i too would rather believe that the president of the united states was an honest decent thoughtful person for some people having an authority figure be trustworthy is so important that they will not accept the obvious facts about trump like other predators or other sociopaths trump takes advantage of this very human quality by pretending to be trustworthy through endless lying about his real motivations and even his real actions donald trump has said and done many unconscionable things during his time in the white house but his recent suggestion that doctors and nurses are stealing ventilators from hospitals is even by standards one of his most despicable comments is that just his instinct — to go to such an unbelievably dark place advertisement as my colleague dr john gartner pointed out if trump were walking around wearing a tinfoil hat and talking about martians controlling his mind it would be easy for the public to recognize how severely ill he is trump is the most dangerous person we could have as a president precisely because his delusional core is not as obvious when he makes these claims about ventilators and the coronavirus they need to be understood as delusional beliefs that he summons from his imagination to protect himself and which he is incapable of altering when presented with reality donald trump actually believes that he is a great president i believe he is likely to win a second term his entire presidency stands as an indictment of the american people the news media the political class and the countrys culture and values as a whole with respect to the political class donald trump would have been removed from office already if the republicans in congress were not propping him up if a democrat were behaving like trump republicans would certainly have impeached and convicted him already many decent americans have been successfully conned by trump but there is no excuse for the republicans in congress trumps decisions about the coronavirus are killing americans and he will continue doing it the congress should remove him from office immediately if trump was not born into wealth what do you think would have happened to him advertisement people with donald trumps very severe personality disorder are rare which is good for civilization but helps explain why most people cannot understand his behavior sociopaths can be camouflaged by being successful in certain areas precisely because they get to the top by lying cheating bullying and manipulating stepping on people who are in their way dictators crime bosses and similar types of people are examples but most sociopaths end up with criminal records donald trump has committed multiple civil crimes that we know of if he had not been born into money it is likely that he would be in prison in terms of metacognition is donald trump aware of what motivates and drives his behavior donald trump has made it clear that he processes reality in a different way than most human beings when he says that if 100000 people were to die from the coronavirus it would be a victory for him he is revealing who he really is he is showing that his perceived selfinterest is the only thing that is ever on his mind insight into himself wouldnt make any sense to him given your expertise in mental health do you find donald trump to be an interesting person to study advertisement i find donald trump to be boring because hes so simple it is always obvious what hes going to do in any situation its merits or complexity will have no bearing on his statements or actions he will simply say or do whatever he thinks will benefit himself part of that calculus of course is to act as though he actually cares about others but with four years of experience everyone now ought to be able to see through that when he was first elected many reporters and commentators wrote that they hoped he would change and become presidential people with the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder do not change this is just who trump is what do you want the american people and the world to be prepared for in terms of donald trumps behavior no matter what happens with the coronavirus donald trump is going to claim victory he will say that he did the best job possible and use the big lie strategy to double down on this falsehood he will blame his critics for his failures with the virus if there is a truly horrible outcome trump will blame the democrats the doctors the governors and anyone else he can imagine while as he has already said taking no responsibility himself

florida man who raised over 22 million on gofundme in the “we the people will build the wall” campaign just revealed today in their opinion money may be diverted to pay for a ‘million dollar’ yacht and highflying lifestyle this article draws on the use of an anonymous source whose identity is being protected because they stepped forward to expose what they believe is a wrongdoing or possibly criminal fraud by the wall gofundme campaign that received over 300000 individual donations that source is a known activist that is protrump and has gone on fox news for his bipartisan cause the source told the stern facts that they “ironically” know brian kolfage who built that wall go fund me page according to the source brian kolfage personally confided that was “broke” last year after his “right wing news” empire—which the source was told was fake but he never read—collapsed and facebook “deplatformed” him kolfage only responded to this story after publication and tsf has responded with a list of questions about his project and continues to investigate his reply response from brian kolfage tsf has requested documentation to substantiate his claims that anonymous source shared an instagram post highlighting kolfage’s recent purchase of a fine seagoing vessel which they believe is “close to a million dollars” after kolfage commented to this story the source said “whether he ordered it last year with the year before is irrelevant it’s still nearly a million dollar boat those new toys are very expensive as is flying private where did he get the money if his business was destroyed by facebook ” story continues below and the rest of the photos are embedded at the bottom of the story in the interests of fairness tsf has provided mr kolfage with a list of five questions about his venture and the opportunity to respond with any documentation regarding his yacht which will be published in this space questions to brian kolfage about his multimilliondollar “build the wall” campaign who is brian kolfage kolfage is a purpleheart decorated war veteran and tripleamputee who lost an empire on facebook of literally “fake news” after the 2016 election kolfage’s gofundme page touched a nerve amongst trump supporters during the president’s government shutdown and while nearly suspended was subjected to a mass optout “that’s why i’m sending it to you i back what’s right” said the anonymous source who elaborated in a phone call about the concern that the money wasn’t being spent on a wall “that money was supposed to be for the wall i hate fuckers that take money under false pretense kolfage is using the wall money to fly private range rovers boats etc…” two days ago the daily beast’s will sommer wrote a story highlighting the nonexistence of any serious plans to purchase land for kolfage’s project which he proudly highlighted with disgraced former kansas secretary of state kris kobach sommer wrote organized by tripleamputee veteran brian kolfage the campaign eventually morphed into a nonprofit called we build the wall which promised to build portions of the wall on private land using the money it raised months later there’s no evidence that any construction has started despite claims from kolfage and his allies that construction would start in april and now greene is wondering what ever happened to that wall he was promised his dollars would fund complicating the effort further is that it’s not that easy to find private land right on the border where a wall can be built kolfage and we build the wall’s board of directors have spent plenty of time in arizona ostensibly scouting private land to build the wall but the phoenix new times reported in march that the “vast majority” of land on the border in the state is owned by the federal government meanwhile many of the people who actually own land on the border told the new times that they hadn’t been contacted by we build the wall the post reports that kolfage would not comment today either and that the ire of his followers is rising after numerous blown dates to begin constructing his wall kolfage’s project only became a possibility only after estranged former white house senior advisor steve bannon kobach and exmilwaukee sheriff david a clarke got involved in early 2017 kris kobach became best known as the person whom president trump appointed to lead a dubious voter fraud commission that made no significant findings he is the former kansas secretary of state kobach got held in contempt of a federal court for being an atrocious lawyer in early 2018 the kansas supreme court ordered a grand jury to investigate his handling of voter registration in 2016 after a citizeninitiated process he then won the gop gubernatorial nomination by a razorthin margin in a primary that his republican opponent openly accused him of cheating to win the recount only to lose the general election by 5points kansas political experts call kobach “democrats best hope” to win an open us senate seat next year story continues below how did we get here even kolfage admitted defeat at one point but the national political figures negotiated a deal to keep the money if their donors did not opt out after a mass email the veteran appeared to have moved on from the project and rapidly started a quirky business selling coins with his face on them presumably to leverage the massive mailing list he collected from his gofundme campaign a month later kolfage told fox news in march that he insisted construction would start “within months” on april 14th they made a press release that claimed 94 optin rate available through the wayback machine and that they identified landowners a call for comment to the we build the wall contact jennifer lawrence was not answered and they didn’t call back that same day the optin period for the fundraiser ended and gofundme has allowed the campaign to remain open for donations to this day the anonymous source indicated they believe there was a “very low” optout rate and that most donors left their money with kolfage the source indicated in strong language that kolfage was manipulating donors with his personal story to support a profligate lifestyle hundreds of thousands of trump supporters paid brian kolfage millions of dollars under false pretenses and he allied himself with some of the most well known least successful republican political figures now not only are thousands of disgruntled donors turning on kolfage but even people who know him personally are turning on the veteran who made millions from intentionally fake news before moving on to what appears to be selling an intentionally fake wall on the internet here are the rest of the photos of brian kolfage’s yacht

that,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/20/mueller-report-impeachment-obstruction-bill-clinton-republicans,madam1,929,39,robert mueller’s report effectively accused donald trump of obstructing justice by witness tampering one of the offences that led republicans to impeach bill clinton 20 years ago mueller’s team found trump repeatedly made efforts to “encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation” into russia’s interference in the 2016 election the special counsel’s final report said trump “made it known” that paul manafort his former campaign chairman could receive a pardon according to mueller the president also urged manafort and michael cohen his legal fixer not to “flip” and help mueller’s inquiry in both these cases mueller found evidence that trump acted with the intent of hindering the investigation – a necessary component for prosecuting witness tampering and obstruction of justice generally in addition mueller found that trump asked senior advisers to tell michael flynn his former national security adviser to “stay strong” and asked for two senior white house officials who were witnesses in the investigation to create fake records that would help protect him donald trump and michael flynn at a rally in grand junction colorado on 18 october 2016 photograph george freygetty images more than three pages describing trump’s potentially obstructive actions towards yet another witness – seemingly his longtime friend and adviser roger stone – were completely redacted in mueller’s report because they related to an “an ongoing matter” stone is being prosecuted on federal charges it is against federal law to tamper with a witness in an “official proceeding” such as mueller’s investigation but mueller’s team declined to conclude whether or not trump’s actions were criminal in part because justice department policy holds that sitting presidents may not be indicted in a move that has attracted sharp criticism from democrats william barr the attorney general decided that trump had not committed obstruction clinton was impeached by the house of representatives in december 1998 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice the obstruction charge said he committed witness tampering by trying to “corruptly influence” the potential testimony of his secretary betty currie and urged the former white house intern monica lewinsky to submit a false affidavit in a lawsuit against him clinton was acquitted by the senate but 14 current republican senators some of whom were then serving in the house voted either to impeach or convict clinton on the obstruction charge some specifically cited his actions toward the witnesses when explaining their votes mitch mcconnell photograph j scott applewhiteap mitch mcconnell kentucky following his deposition the president had to decide what to do with his loyal secretary ms betty currie and again the undisputed evidence shows that the president took the path of lies and deceit contrary to federal obstruction of justice laws and contrary to judge wright’s protective order … president clinton left the deposition went back to the white house and called ms currie at home to ask her to come to the white house the next day which i might add was a sunday … i am completely and utterly perplexed by those who argue that perjury and obstruction of justice are not high crimes and misdemeanors senate floor 12 february 1999 chuck grassley photograph drew angerergetty images chuck grassley iowa it is clear to me that the president committed serious crimes when he coached his secretary betty currie and when he misled his aides sidney blumenthal and john podesta … these actions weren’t just outrageous and morally wrong they were also illegal they were a direct assault on the integrity of the judicial process statement 12 february 1999 lindsey graham photograph ethan millergetty images lindsey graham south carolina the question i have that needs to desperately be answered by somebody is – when he approached ms currie to coach her in the fashion he did is that a crime because i don’t want people at home to be confused that they can do these things because if they do what the president did in my opinion they will wind up in jail interview with cnn 27 january 1999 nobody because of their position in society has the right to cheat and to get somebody to lie for them even as the president that means we’re not a nation of men or kings we’re a nation of laws and that’s what this case has always been about to me … he turned the judicial

in the constitution as ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ so warranting removal from office our constitution requires that the threshold for that judgment must be set by each senator sitting as a juror i

lawyers have argued that the president made these statements to refresh his recollection or to find out what ms currie knew in the event of a press avalanche neither of these explanations is plausible it is impossible to refresh one’s recollection with false leading questions it is also impossible to find out what someone else knew if you tell them what they are supposed to believe the plausibility of either of these explanations is entirely discounted when you consider that the president called betty currie in a second time on january 20 to ‘remind’ her of these statements the most likely explanation for these statements is far more sinister that the president was intending to influence the testimony of a likely witness in a federal civil rights proceeding president clinton was in fact

New York prosecutors are about to cross it.,https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-prosecutors-investigate-trump-finances-cohen-testimony-2019-3,progress18,924,49,state prosecutors in new york are using michael cohens congressional testimony to guide them as they investigate whether president donald trump committed a variety of financial crimes as he built his vast realestate empire the washington post on thursday published a lengthy look at how trump went about inflating and deflating the value of his assets for insurance and tax purposes after cohen testified to congress new york authorities and congressional investigators sent subpoenas and document requests to trumps insurance provider financial institutions and more meanwhile federal prosecutors in the new york city boroughs of manhattan and brooklyn are known to be investigating trumps business dealings before the election and his inaugural committee respectively new york law is known to be tough on financial crime and experts say the state probe — not the russia investigation — poses the greatest legal threat to trumps businesses and his presidency new york state prosecutors are using michael cohens testimony to the house oversight committee to point them in the right direction as they investigate president donald trumps sprawling realestate empire business dealings and finances cohen trumps former longtime lawyer and fixer appeared before the committee in an open hearing last month where he called the president a cheat and a con man and said he was involved in wrongdoing or criminal conduct among other things cohen told the committee that trump had inflated his assets for insurance purposes and deflated them for tax purposes who else knows that the president did this rep alexandria ocasiocortez who questioned cohen extensively about trumps finances asked him allen weisselberg ron lieberman and matthew calamari cohen answered and where would the committee find more information on this ocasiocortez asked do you think we need to review his financial statements and his tax returns in order to compare them yes and youd find it at the trump org cohen said referring to the trump organization read more the 8 biggest takeaways from michael cohens blockbuster testimony against trump new york prosecutors follow cohens breadcrumbs michael cohen ap photojulie jacobson it looks like new york authorities — as well as congressional investigators — took cohens cues according to the washington post which on thursday published a detailed look at how trump inflated his assets and net worth to authorities and investors on wednesday the house oversight committee announced that it had requested 10 years of trumps financial statements from his accounting firm mazars usa the post reported that the committee also asked mazars for supporting documents used to produce those statements as well as communications between the firm and trump meanwhile earlier this month the new york state department of financial services subpoenaed records from aon trumps longtime insurance company a person with knowledge of the subpoena told usa today the request sought records of communications involving aon trump and his company as well as internal documents for related insurance coverage the new york state attorney generals office has also subpoenaed deutsche bank which cohen said received financial statements from trump that misrepresented his assets read more prosecutors left a trail of breadcrumbs about trumps finances and house democrats are now digging deeper trumps financial worth has perhaps been the biggest question mark looming over his realestate career in 2009 he told the wall street journal he was worth 5 billion not including the value of the trump brand a month later trumps accountant prepared a financial statement that said his net worth was in excess of 3 billion two years later trump bragged during a comedy central roast that he was worth more than 7 billion in may 2016 at the height of that years presidential election trump said in a press release that he was worth more than 10 billion the president has admitted that the statements he makes about his financial worth are not always based in fact in 2007 trump sued the journalist timothy obrien after obrien wrote in his book trumpnation the art of being the donald that trumps actual net worth was between 150 million and 250 million in a deposition trump gave for the lawsuit — which was eventually dismissed — he acknowledged that his net worth fluctuated based on his emotions read more heres a glimpse at trumps decadeslong history of business ties to russia its not uncommon for realestate businessmen to exaggerate their net worths the problem arises when one inflates or deflates their net worth or makes false representations about their financial stability in order to mislead potential investors and authorities accountants reportedly did not verify the figures trump gave them for his financial statements according to the post when mazars usa was putting together statements of trumps financial stability accountants at the firm did not verify the figures trump provided to them saying that it was not their job to check for their authenticity when asked if the values provided have to be logical one of the accountants replied the value per se does not have to be logical trump is weathering at least 16 known investigations into his finances his business his inaugural committee his campaign and more for a long time it seemed like the special counsel robert muellers russia investigation — which examined whether members of the trump campaign conspired with russia during the 2016 election and whether trump obstructed justice — posed the greatest legal threat to the president and those around him but over the last several months state and federal prosecutors in new york have emerged as a bigger risk investigators in the southern district of new york sdny are delving into trumps business dealings before the election centering around hushmoney payments that cohen facilitated to women who said they had affairs with trump read more new york state prosecutors indict manafort on new charges just minutes after he was sentenced to 7 12 years in prison in the mueller probe cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion bank fraud and campaignfinance violations as part of that investigation in their charging document prosecutors wrote that cohen admitted to breaking election law at the request and direction of individual1 who is widely believed to be trump cohens allegations make trump an unindicted coconspirator in the sdnys investigation legal experts say demanding records from trumps inauguration committee recently the sdny also recently subpoenaed the trump inaugural committee for documents related to its finances the subpoena came from the offices public corruption unit abc news reported meanwhile the us attorneys office in brooklyn new york is conducting a separate investigation into possible illegal donations made by foreign entities and cohen told the house oversight committee the sdny is investigating wrongdoing or illegal acts involving trump that have not yet been publicly revealed getty images paul morigi trumps alleged financial misconduct in new york could be what actually sinks the big ship new york also has jurisdiction over the linchpin to trumps success his businesses the trump campaign moreover is headquartered at trump tower in manhattan new york and state investigators have cited that as a key reason they want to obtain a full unredacted copy of muellers report in the russia investigation specifically they believe the document could contain evidence of criminal wrongdoing that could be subject to state charges against trump or people in his orbit such as his children and other family members new york authorities as well as the states law are also known to be tough on financial crime fraud cases are the linchpin of what most attorneys general do and the laws are particularly strong in new york paul nolette a politicalscience professor at marquette university who studies attorneys general told fivethirtyeight in january the mueller investigation is the shiny object everyone is watching berit berger a former federal prosecutor and the executive director of columbia law schools center for the advancement of public integrity told the outlet but under everyones nose are what look like much more straightforward violations of state law including some pretty flagrant tax fraud depending on what happens with mueller that could be what actually sinks the big ship its not just trump who could face legal jeopardy in his home state people who are convicted of state crimes cannot be pardoned and trumps children other family members and campaign associates may also see trouble ahead as paul manafort trumps former campaign manager found out earlier this month just minutes after manafort was sentenced to 7 12 years in federal prison as a result of the mueller probe state prosecutors in new york slapped him with a 16count indictment accusing him of engaging in a yearlong fraud scheme to falsify business records and illegally obtain millions of dollars in loans
