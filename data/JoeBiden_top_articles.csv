""I'm not going to waste my time"".",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/08/second-presidential-debate-between-trump-and-biden-on-oct-15-will-be-virtual.html,IrishGuyNYC00,6858,286,washington — president donald trump on thursday said he would not participate in his second official presidential debate with democratic nominee joe biden after the bipartisan presidential debate commission shifted the event format from a inperson townhall to a virtual one no im not going to waste my time on a virtual debate he said during an interview thursday morning on the fox business channel his campaign later said trump will hold a rally that night instead the second of three presidential debates this fall was originally slated to take place in miami florida on oct 15 both the biden and trump campaigns had agreed to the date location and format back in june then last friday trump announced that he and first lady melania trump had tested positive for the coronavirus since then more than a dozen white house officials have tested positive for covid19 citing a need to protect the health and safety of all involved the debate commission announced thursday morning that the miami debate would remain in a townhall format but that candidates would participate from separate remote locations trump and his allies quickly claimed without evidence that the commission had made the change to favor biden a biden campaign source told nbc news that the cpd made the decision independently over the course of the day thursday the biden and trump campaigns issued a flurry of competing proposals for what should happen next following trumps refusal to do a virtual debate the biden campaign proposed that the third and final debate currently scheduled for oct 22 be held as a townhall debate instead of just the two men and a moderator the trump campaign tentatively agreed to a townhall on oct 22 but then they demanded a third and final debate on oct 29 arguing that an oct 22 town hall was essentially a rescheduling of next weeks debate the biden campaign rejected the idea of adding another debate day noting that it was trump not biden who blew up the oct 15 debate by refusing to participate under the rules set by the commission on thursday afternoon abc news announced that biden had agreed to do a town hall with the network on oct 15 in pennsylvania effectively closing the door to additional negotiations trump however wasnt finished negotiating at around 700 pm et the white house released a memo from trumps physician sean conley saying that he expected the president could make a safe return to public engagements this saturday exactly 10 days after trump was first diagnosed with covid19 citing the latest memo trumps campaign then put out a statement arguing that there was no medical reason why the commission on presidential debates should shift the oct 15 debate to a virtual setting postpone it or otherwise alter it in any way but experts say it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when a covid patient is no longer contagious and they urge doctors and patients to err on the side of caution
j4yn2h,2020-10-04 16:06:35,JoeBiden,Biden's national lead over Trump jumps to 14 points after debate in NBC News/WSJ poll,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/biden-s-national-lead-over-trump-jumps-14-points-after-n1242018,DrBrotatoJr,6193,466,washington — joe bidens national lead over president donald trump nearly doubled after tuesdays presidential debate with voters saying by 2to1 that biden has the better temperament to be president according to a new nbc newswall street journal poll the poll was conducted in the two days after the unruly and insultfilled debate tuesday but before trump tested positive for covid19 and was hospitalized friday at walter reed national military medical center biden is now ahead of trump by 14 points among registered voters 53 percent to 39 percent — up from his 8point lead in the previous poll before the debate the 14point advantage represents bidens largest lead in the nbc newswsj poll during the entire campaign his previous high was 11 points in july the clear loser from the debate was donald trump said democratic pollster jeff horwitt of hart research associates who conducted the survey with republican pollster bill mcinturff of public opinion strategies and at least for the short term this has damaged his standing against joe biden horwitt added but mcinturff the republican pollster cautioned that the survey could represent a shock to the system right after a consequential debate democrats for example hold a 9point advantage in party identification in the poll compared to 5 to 6point advantages in previous ones as a result mcinturff said the race could return to the stable 8 to 9point margin it has essentially been at over the last several months — which is still a difficult place for an incumbent four weeks before election day the biggest declines for trump were among seniors who now back biden by 62 percent to 35 percent and suburban women 58 percent to 33 percent and men 50 years and older moved to a 1point advantage for biden in the latest poll compared to a 13point advantage for trump in the predebate nbc newswsj poll voters say biden did a better job at the debate by 2to1 fortynine percent of voters say biden did a better job at tuesdays debate which was marked by insults interruptions falsehoods and personal attacks — most although not all coming from the president thats compared with 24 percent who say trump did better another 17 percent say neither did a better job in addition 19 percent of voters say theyre more likely to support biden after the debate compared to 6 percent who say theyre more likely to back trump the vast majority — 73 percent — say the debate made no difference in how theyd vote among the 49 percent who say biden did a better job many voters cited trumps performance when asked to describe what they thought was important at the debate basically last night was a snapshot of the last three and a half years not being able to say anything about white supremacists being negative and being unpresidential one respondent said another voter who thought biden did a better job said i just think it was the same old trump he was bullying even among the 24 percent who say trump did the better job the responses were as much about the presidents performance as bidens i would say donald trumps admittance of not supporting white supremacists telling the white supremacists to stand down so to speak by the moderator the other important thing was joe bidens inability to form any coherent response said a voter who thought trump did a better job democratic pollster peter hart summing up the voter responses said its trumps debate not bidens debate bidens presidential temperament advantage the new poll also finds biden holding a whopping 32point advantage on which candidate has the better temperament to be president with 58 percent of voters picking biden compared to 26 percent picking trump that margin is greater than bidens advantages over trump on handling race relations 29 points health care 19 points and the coronavirus 17 points trump maintains his edge over biden in handling the economy but the margin declined from 10 points before the debate 48 percent to 38 percent to 7 points in the new poll 48 percent to 41 percent although that change is within the margin of sampling error trumps approval rating stands at 43 percent fortythree percent of registered voters approve of trumps job performance in the new poll which is down by 2 points from the last nbc newswsj poll fiftyfive percent disapprove of trumps job performance including 50 percent who say they strongly disapprove trumps favorability rating also dropped — from 41 percent positive52 percent negative before the debate 11 to 39 percent positive55 percent negative now 16 conversely the poll shows bidens favorability rating increasing — from 43 percent positive45 percent negative 2 to 43 percent positive41 percent negative after the debate 2 first numbers on trumps supreme court pick finally the poll asked voters about trumps pick to succeed the late ruth bader ginsburg on the supreme court amy coney barrett thirtyfive percent of registered voters say they support barretts nomination while 33 percent oppose it 30 percent say they dont know enough about her the findings are similar to the first nbc newswsj numbers on trumps 2018 supreme court pick brett kavanaugh whom the senate confirmed by a narrow 5048 vote in a separate question 50 percent of voters say they would prefer the senate to wait to fill the supreme court seat until theres a winner in the presidential contest while 38 percent want a vote before the election the nbc newswall street journal poll which was conducted sept 30oct 1 among 800 registered voters — more than half of whom were reached by cellphone — has an overall margin of error of plusminus 35 percentage points

decades, revealing struggling properties, vast write-offs, an audit battle and hundreds of millions in debt coming due.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html,progress18,5624,359,the times obtained donald trump’s tax information extending over more than two decades revealing struggling properties vast writeoffs an audit battle and hundreds of millions in debt coming due donald j trump paid 750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency in his first year in the white house he paid another 750 he had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years — largely because he reported losing much more money than he made as the president wages a reelection campaign that polls say he is in danger of losing his finances are under stress beset by losses and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt coming due that he has personally guaranteed also hanging over him is a decadelong audit battle with the internal revenue service over the legitimacy of a 729 million tax refund that he claimed and received after declaring huge losses an adverse ruling could cost him more than 100 million the tax returns that mr trump has long fought to keep private tell a story fundamentally different from the one he has sold to the american public his reports to the irs portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes now with his financial challenges mounting the records show that he depends more and more on making money from businesses that put him in potential and often direct conflict of interest with his job as president the new york times has obtained taxreturn data extending over more than two decades for mr trump and the hundreds of companies that make up his business organization including detailed information from his first two years in office it does not include his personal returns for 2018 or 2019 this article offers an overview of the times’s findings additional articles will be published in the coming weeks the returns are some of the most soughtafter and speculatedabout records in recent memory in mr trump’s nearly four years in office — and across his endlessly hyped decades in the public eye — journalists prosecutors opposition politicians and conspiracists have with limited success sought to excavate the enigmas of his finances by their very nature the filings will leave many questions unanswered many questioners unfulfilled they comprise information that mr trump has disclosed to the irs not the findings of an independent financial examination they report that mr trump owns hundreds of millions of dollars in valuable assets but they do not reveal his true wealth nor do they reveal any previously unreported connections to russia in response to a letter summarizing the times’s findings alan garten a lawyer for the trump organization said that “most if not all of the facts appear to be inaccurate” and requested the documents on which they were based after the times declined to provide the records in order to protect its sources mr garten took direct issue only with the amount of taxes mr trump had paid “over the past decade president trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015” mr garten said in a statement with the term “personal taxes” however mr garten appears to be conflating income taxes with other federal taxes mr trump has paid — social security medicare and taxes for his household employees mr garten also asserted that some of what the president owed was “paid with tax credits” a misleading characterization of credits which reduce a business owner’s incometax bill as a reward for various activities like historic preservation the tax data examined by the times provides a road map of revelations from writeoffs for the cost of a criminal defense lawyer and a mansion used as a family retreat to a full accounting of the millions of dollars the president received from the 2013 miss universe pageant in moscow together with related financial documents and legal filings the records offer the most detailed look yet inside the president’s business empire they reveal the hollowness but also the wizardry behind the selfmadebillionaire image — honed through his star turn on “the apprentice” — that helped propel him to the white house and that still undergirds the loyalty of many in his base ultimately mr trump has been more successful playing a business mogul than being one in real life “the apprentice” along with the licensing and endorsement deals that flowed from his expanding celebrity brought mr trump a total of 4274 million the times’s analysis of the records found he invested much of that in a collection of businesses mostly golf courses that in the years since have steadily devoured cash — much as the money he secretly received from his father financed a spree of quixotic overspending that led to his collapse in the early 1990s “the apprentice” along with endorsements and other income that sprang from his growing fame brought donald trump 4274 million rob delorenzozuma press indeed his financial condition when he announced his run for president in 2015 lends some credence to the notion that his longshot campaign was at least in part a gambit to reanimate the marketability of his name as the legal and political battles over access to his tax returns have intensified mr trump has often wondered aloud why anyone would even want to see them “there’s nothing to learn from them” he told the associated press in 2016 there is far more useful information he has said in the annual financial disclosures required of him as president — which he has pointed to as evidence of his mastery of a flourishing and immensely profitable business universe in fact those public filings offer a distorted picture of his financial state since they simply report revenue not profit in 2018 for example mr trump announced in his disclosure that he had made at least 4349 million the tax records deliver a very different portrait of his bottom line 474 million in losses tax records do not have the specificity to evaluate the legitimacy of every business expense mr trump claims to reduce his taxable income — for instance without any explanation in his returns the general and administrative expenses at his bedminster golf club in new jersey increased fivefold from 2016 to 2017 and he has previously bragged that his ability to get by without paying taxes “makes me smart” as he said in 2016 but the returns by his own account undercut his claims of financial acumen showing that he is simply pouring more money into many businesses than he is taking out the picture that perhaps emerges most starkly from the mountain of figures and tax schedules prepared by mr trump’s accountants is of a businessmanpresident in a tightening financial vise most of mr trump’s core enterprises — from his constellation of golf courses to his conservativemagnet hotel in washington — report losing millions if not tens of millions of dollars year after year listen to this article his revenue from “the apprentice” and from licensing deals is drying up and several years ago he sold nearly all the stocks that now might have helped him plug holes in his struggling properties the tax audit looms and within the next four years more than 300 million in loans — obligations for which he is personally responsible — will come due against that backdrop the records go much further toward revealing the actual and potential conflicts of interest created by mr trump’s refusal to divest himself of his business interests while in the white house his properties have become bazaars for collecting money directly from lobbyists foreign officials and others seeking face time access or favor the records for the first time put precise dollar figures on those transactions at the maralago club in palm beach fla a flood of new members starting in 2015 allowed him to pocket an additional 5 million a year from the business in 2017 the billy graham evangelistic association paid at least 397602 to the washington hotel where the group held at least one event during its fourday world summit in defense of persecuted christians the times was also able to take the fullest measure to date of the president’s income from overseas where he holds ultimate sway over american diplomacy when he took office mr trump said he would pursue no new foreign deals as president even so in his first two years in the white house his revenue from abroad totaled 73 million and while much of that money was from his golf properties in scotland and ireland some came from licensing deals in countries with authoritarianleaning leaders or thorny geopolitics — for example 3 million from the philippines 23 million from india and 1 million from turkey in the philippines where mr trump licensed his name to a manila tower he or his companies paid 156824 in taxes in 2017 hannah reyes morales for the new york times he reported paying taxes in turn on a number of his overseas ventures in 2017 the president’s 750 contribution to the operations of the us government was dwarfed by the 15598 he or his companies paid in panama the 145400 in india and the 156824 in the philippines the 750 tax bill here’s how his accountants arrived at that figure in 2017 mr trump’s us payment after factoring in his losses was roughly equivalent in dollars not adjusted for inflation to another presidential tax bill revealed nearly a halfcentury before in 1973 the providence journal reported that after a charitable deduction for donating his presidential papers richard m nixon had paid 79281 in 1970 on income of about 200000 the leak of mr nixon’s small tax payment caused a precedentsetting uproar henceforth presidents and presidential candidates would make their tax returns available for the american people to see a map of the empire the contents of thousands of personal and business tax records fill in financial details that have been withheld for years “i would love to do that” mr trump said in 2014 when asked whether he would release his taxes if he ran for president he’s been backpedaling ever since when he ran he said he might make his taxes public if hillary clinton did the same with the deleted emails from her private server — an echo of his taunt while stoking the birther fiction that he might release the returns if president barack obama released his birth certificate he once boasted that his tax returns were “very big” and “beautiful” but making them public “it’s very complicated” he often claims that he cannot do so while under audit — an argument refuted by his own irs commissioner when prosecutors and congressional investigators issued subpoenas for his returns he wielded not just his private lawyers but also the power of his justice department to stalemate them all the way to the supreme court mr trump’s elaborate dance and defiance have only stoked suspicion about what secrets might lie hidden in his taxes is there a financial clue to his deference to russia and its president vladimir v putin did he write off as a business expense the hushmoney payment to the pornographic film star stormy daniels in the days before the 2016 election did a covert source of money feed his frenzy of acquisition that began in the mid2000s the times examined and analyzed the data from thousands of individual and business tax returns for 2000 through 2017 along with additional tax information from other years the trove included years of employee compensation information and records of cash payments between the president and his businesses as well as information about ongoing federal audits of his taxes this article also draws upon dozens of interviews and previously unreported material from other sources both public and confidential all of the information the times obtained was provided by sources with legal access to it while most of the tax data has not previously been made public the times was able to verify portions of it by comparing it with publicly available information and confidential records previously obtained by the times to delve into the records is to see up close the complex structure of the president’s business interests — and the depth of his entanglements what is popularly known as the trump organization is in fact a collection of more than 500 entities virtually all of them wholly owned by mr trump many carrying his name for example 105 of them are a variation of the name trump marks which he uses for licensing deals fragments of mr trump’s tax returns have leaked out before transcripts of his main federal tax form the 1040 from 1985 to 1994 were obtained by the times in 2019 they showed that in many years mr trump lost more money than nearly any other individual american taxpayer three pages of his 1995 returns mailed anonymously to the times during the 2016 campaign showed that mr trump had declared losses of 9157 million giving him a tax deduction that could have allowed him to avoid federal income taxes for almost two decades five months later the journalist david cay johnston obtained two pages of mr trump’s returns from 2005 that year his fortunes had rebounded to the point that he was paying taxes in 1995 the year mr trump broke ground on the trump international hotel and tower in new york he would declare losses of 9157 million — a sum so large it could be carried forward to cancel out taxable income for years francis speckernew york post archives via nyp holdings inc via getty images by 2005 his fortunes had turned and he was paying income taxes he had exhausted the taxreducing power of that nearly 1 billion loss just as he began to see a surge of celebrity income after “the apprentice” debuted michael naglegetty images the vast new trove of information analyzed by the times completes the recurring pattern of ascent and decline that has defined the president’s career even so it has its limits tax returns do not for example record net worth — in mr trump’s case a topic of much posturing and almost as much debate the documents chart a great churn of money but while returns report debts they often do not identify lenders the data contains no new revelations about the 130000 payment to stephanie clifford the actress who performs as stormy daniels — a focus of the manhattan district attorney’s subpoena for mr trump’s tax returns and other financial information mr trump has acknowledged reimbursing his former lawyer michael d cohen who made the payoff but the materials obtained by the times did not include any itemized payments to mr cohen the amount however could have been improperly included in legal fees written off as a business expense which are not required to be itemized on tax returns no subject has provoked more intense speculation about mr trump’s finances than his connection to russia while the tax records revealed no previously unknown financial connection — and for the most part lack the specificity required to do so — they did shed new light on the money behind the 2013 miss universe pageant in moscow a subject of enduring intrigue because of subsequent investigations into russia’s interference in the 2016 election the records show that the pageant was the most profitable miss universe during mr trump’s time as coowner and that it generated a personal payday of 23 million — made possible at least in part by the agalarov family who would later help set up the infamous 2016 meeting between trump campaign officials seeking “dirt” on mrs clinton and a russian lawyer connected to the kremlin in august the senate intelligence committee released a report that looked extensively into the circumstances of the moscow pageant and revealed that as recently as february investigators subpoenaed the russian singer emin agalarov who was involved in planning it mr agalarov’s father aras a billionaire who boasts of close ties to mr putin was mr trump’s partner in the event emin agalarov left a russian singer whose family was involved in planning the 2013 miss universe pageant in moscow mr trump made 23 million from that year’s pageant the records show irina bujorkommersantru via associated press the committee interviewed a top miss universe executive paula shugart who said the agalarovs offered to underwrite the event their family business crocus group paid a 6 million licensing fee and another 6 million in expenses but while the pageant proved to be a financial loss for the agalarovs — they recouped only 2 million — ms shugart told investigators that it was “one of the most lucrative deals” the miss universe organization ever made according to the report that is borne out by the tax records they show that in 2013 the pageant reported 316 million in gross receipts — the highest since at least the 1990s — allowing mr trump and his coowner nbc to split profits of 47 million by comparison mr trump and nbc shared losses of 2 million from the pageant the year before the moscow event and 38 million from the one the year after loser winner losses reported by businesses mr trump owns and runs helped wipe out tax bills on hundreds of millions of dollars in celebrity income while mr trump crisscrossed the country in 2015 describing himself as uniquely qualified to be president because he was “really rich” and had “built a great company” his accountants back in new york were busy putting the finishing touches on his 2014 tax return after tabulating all the profits and losses from mr trump’s various endeavors on form 1040 the accountants came to line 56 where they had to enter the total income tax the candidate was required to pay they needed space for only a single figure zero for mr trump that bottom line must have looked familiar it was the fourth year in a row that he had not paid a penny of federal income taxes mr trump’s avoidance of income taxes is one of the most striking discoveries in his tax returns especially given the vast wash of income itemized elsewhere in those filings mr trump’s net income from his fame — his 50 percent share of “the apprentice” together with the riches showered upon him by the scores of suitors paying to use his name — totaled 4274 million through 2018 a further 1765 million in profit came to him through his investment in two highly successful office buildings so how did he escape nearly all taxes on that fortune even the effective tax rate paid by the wealthiest 1 percent of americans could have caused him to pay more than 100 million the answer rests in a third category of mr trump’s endeavors businesses that he owns and runs himself the collective and persistent losses he reported from them largely absolved him from paying federal income taxes on the 600 million from “the apprentice” branding deals and investments that equation is a key element of the alchemy of mr trump’s finances using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses then wielding their losses to avoid taxes throughout his career mr trump’s business losses have often accumulated in sums larger than could be used to reduce taxes on other income in a single year but the tax code offers a workaround with some restrictions business owners can carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years that provision has been the background music to mr trump’s life as the times’s previous reporting on his 1995 return showed the nearly 1 billion in losses from his early1990s collapse generated a tax deduction that he could use for up to 18 years going forward the newer tax returns show that mr trump burned through the last of the taxreducing power of that 1 billion in 2005 just as a torrent of entertainment riches began coming his way following the debut of “the apprentice” the year before for 2005 through 2007 cash from licensing deals and endorsements filled mr trump’s bank accounts with 120 million in pure profit with no prioryear losses left to reduce his taxable income he paid substantial federal income taxes for the first time in his life a total of 701 million as his celebrity income swelled mr trump went on a buying spree unlike any he had had since the 1980s when eager banks and his father’s wealth allowed him to buy or build the casinos airplanes yacht and old hotel that would soon lay him low when “the apprentice” premiered mr trump had opened only two golf courses and was renovating two more by the end of 2015 he had 15 courses and was transforming the old post office building in washington into a trump international hotel but rather than making him wealthier the tax records reveal as never before each new acquisition only fed the downward draft on his bottom line consider the results at his largest golf resort trump national doral near miami mr trump bought the resort for 150 million in 2012 through 2018 his losses have totaled 1623 million he has pumped 213 million of fresh cash into doral tax records show and has a 125 million mortgage balance coming due in three years trump national doral near miami mr trump’s largest golf resort since 2000 he has reported losing 3156 million at his golf courses scott mcintyre for the new york times his three courses in europe — two in scotland and one in ireland — have reported a combined 636 million in losses over all since 2000 mr trump has reported losses of 3156 million at the golf courses that are his prized possessions for all of its trumpworld allure his washington hotel opened in 2016 has not fared much better its tax records show losses through 2018 of 555 million and trump corporation a real estate services company has reported losing 134 million since 2000 mr trump personally bankrolled the losses year after year marking his cash infusions as a loan with an everincreasing balance his tax records show in 2016 he gave up on getting paid back and turned the loan into a cash contribution mr trump has often posited that his losses are more accounting magic than actual money out the door last year after the times published details of his tax returns from the 1980s and 1990s he attributed the red ink to depreciation which he said in a tweet would show “losses in almost all cases” and that “much was non monetary” “i love depreciation” mr trump said during a presidential debate in 2016 depreciation though is not a magic wand — it involves real money spent or borrowed to buy buildings or other assets that are expected to last years those costs must be spread out as expenses and deducted over the useful life of the asset even so the rules do hold particular advantages for real estate developers like mr trump who are allowed to use their real estate losses to reduce their taxable income from other activities what the tax records for mr trump’s businesses show however is that he has lost chunks of his fortune even before depreciation is figured in the three european golf courses the washington hotel doral and trump corporation reported losing a total of 1503 million from 2010 through 2018 without including depreciation as an expense to see what a successful business looks like depreciation or not look no further than one in mr trump’s portfolio that he does not manage after plans for a trumpbranded minicity on the far west side of manhattan stalled in the 1990s mr trump’s stake was sold by his partner to vornado realty trust mr trump objected to the sale in court saying he had not been consulted but he ended up with a 30 percent share of two valuable office buildings owned and operated by vornado his share of the profits through the end of 2018 totaled 1765 million with depreciation factored in he has never had to invest more money in the partnership tax records show among businesses he runs mr trump’s first success remains his best the retail and commercial spaces at trump tower completed in 1983 have reliably delivered more than 20 million a year in profits a total of 3363 million since 2000 that has done much to help keep him afloat mr trump has an established track record of stiffing his lenders but the tax returns reveal that he has failed to pay back far more money than previously known a total of 287 million since 2010 the irs considers forgiven debt to be income but mr trump was able to avoid taxes on much of that money by reducing his ability to declare future business losses for the rest he took advantage of a provision of the great recession bailout that allowed income from canceled debt to be completely deferred for five years then spread out evenly over the next five he declared the first 282 million in 2014 once again his business losses mostly absolved his tax responsibilities he paid no federal income taxes for 2014 mr trump was periodically required to pay a parallel income tax called the alternative minimum tax created as a tripwire to prevent wealthy people from using huge deductions including business losses to entirely wipe out their tax liabilities mr trump paid alternative minimum tax in seven years between 2000 and 2017 — a total of 243 million excluding refunds he received after filing for 2015 he paid 641931 his first payment of any federal income tax since 2010 as he settled into the oval office his tax bills soon returned to form his potential taxable income in 2016 and 2017 included 248 million in profits from sources related to his celebrity status and 564 million for the loans he did not repay the dreaded alternative minimum tax would let his business losses erase only some of his liability each time he requested an extension to file his 1040 and each time he made the required payment to the irs for income taxes he might owe — 1 million for 2016 and 42 million for 2017 but virtually all of that liability was washed away when he eventually filed and most of the payments were rolled forward to cover potential taxes in future years to cancel out the tax bills mr trump made use of 97 million in business investment credits at least some of which related to his renovation of the old post office hotel which qualified for a historicpreservation tax break although he had more than enough credits to owe no taxes at all his accountants appear to have carved out an allowance for a small tax liability for both 2016 and 2017 when they got to line 56 the one for income taxes due the amount was the same each year 750 the 729 million maneuver “the apprentice” created what was probably the biggest income tax bite of mr trump’s life during the great recession bailout he asked for the money back testifying before congress in february 2019 the president’s estranged personal lawyer mr cohen recalled mr trump’s showing him a huge check from the us treasury some years earlier and musing “that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving someone like him that much money back” in fact confidential records show that starting in 2010 he claimed and received an income tax refund totaling 729 million — all the federal income tax he had paid for 2005 through 2008 plus interest the legitimacy of that refund is at the center of the audit battle that he has long been waging out of public view with the irs the records that the times reviewed square with the way mr trump has repeatedly cited without explanation an ongoing audit as grounds for refusing to release his tax returns he alluded to it as recently as july on fox news when he told sean hannity “they treat me horribly the irs horribly” and while the records do not lay out all the details of the audit they match his lawyers’ statement during the 2016 campaign that audits of his returns for 2009 and subsequent years remained open and involved “transactions or activities that were also reported on returns for 2008 and earlier” mr trump harvested that refund bonanza by declaring huge business losses — a total of 14 billion from his core businesses for 2008 and 2009 — that tax laws had prevented him from using in prior years but to turn that long arc of failure into a giant refund check he relied on some deft accounting footwork and an unwitting gift from an unlikely source — mr obama business losses can work like a taxavoidance coupon a dollar lost on one business reduces a dollar of taxable income from elsewhere the types and amounts of income that can be used in a given year vary depending on an owner’s tax status but some losses can be saved for later use or even used to request a refund on taxes paid in a prior year until 2009 those coupons could be used to wipe away taxes going back only two years but that november the window was more than doubled by a littlenoticed provision in a bill mr obama signed as part of the great recession recovery effort now business owners could request full refunds of taxes paid in the prior four years and 50 percent of those from the year before that mr trump had paid no income taxes in 2008 but the change meant that when he filed his taxes for 2009 he could seek a refund of not just the 133 million he had paid in 2007 but also the combined 569 million paid in 2005 and 2006 when “the apprentice” created what was likely the biggest income tax bite of his life the records reviewed by the times indicate that mr trump filed for the first of several tranches of his refund several weeks later in january 2010 that set off what tax professionals refer to as a “quickie refund” a check processed in 90 days on a tentative basis pending an audit by the irs his total federal income tax refund would eventually grow to 701 million plus 2733184 in interest he also received 212 million in state and local refunds which often piggyback on federal filings whether mr trump gets to keep the cash though remains far from a sure thing refunds require the approval of irs auditors and an opinion of the congressional joint committee on taxation a bipartisan panel better known for reviewing the impact of tax legislation tax law requires the committee to weigh in on all refunds larger than 2 million to individuals records show that the results of an audit of mr trump’s refund were sent to the joint committee in the spring of 2011 an agreement was reached in late 2014 the documents indicate but the audit resumed and grew to include mr trump’s returns for 2010 through 2013 in the spring of 2016 with mr trump closing in on the republican nomination the case was sent back to the committee it has remained there unresolved with the statute of limitations repeatedly pushed forward precisely why the case has stalled is not clear but experts say it suggests that the gap between the sides remains wide if negotiations were to deadlock the case would move to federal court where it could become a matter of public record the dispute may center on a single claim that jumps off the page of mr trump’s 2009 tax return a declaration of more than 700 million in business losses that he had not been allowed to use in prior years unleashing that giant taxavoidance coupon enabled him to receive some or all of his refund the material obtained by the times does not identify the business or businesses that generated those losses but the losses were a kind that can be claimed only when partners give up their interest in a business and in 2009 mr trump parted ways with a giant money loser his longfailing atlantic city casinos mr trump announced in 2009 that he was abandoning his stake in his atlantic city casino business mark makela for the new york times after mr trump’s bondholders rebuffed his offer to buy them out and with a third round of bankruptcy only a week away mr trump announced in february 2009 that he was quitting the board of directors “if i’m not going to run it i don’t want to be involved in it” he told the associated press “i’m one of the largest developers in the world i have a lot of cash and plenty of places i can go” the same day he notified the securities and exchange commission that he had “determined that his partnership interests are worthless and lack potential to regain value” and was “hereby abandoning” his stake the language was crucial mr trump was using the precise wording of irs rules governing the most beneficial and perhaps aggressive method for business owners to avoid taxes when separating from a business a partner who walks away from a business with nothing — what tax laws refer to as abandonment — can suddenly declare all the losses on the business that could not be used in prior years but there are a few catches including this abandonment is essentially an allornothing proposition if the irs learns that the owner received anything of value the allowable losses are reduced to just 3000 a year and mr trump does appear to have received something when the casino bankruptcy concluded he got 5 percent of the stock in the new company the materials reviewed by the times do not make clear whether mr trump’s refund application reflected his public declaration of abandonment if it did that 5 percent could place his entire refund in question if the auditors ultimately disallow mr trump’s 729 million federal refund he will be forced to return that money with interest and possibly penalties a total that could exceed 100 million he could also be ordered to return the state and local refunds based on the same claims in response to a question about the audit mr garten the trump organization lawyer said facts cited by the times were incorrect without citing specifics he did however write that it was “illogical” to say mr trump had not paid taxes for those three years just because the money was later refunded “while you claim that president trump paid no taxes in 10 of the 15 previous years” mr garten said “you also assert that president trump claimed a massive refund for tens of millions for taxes he did pay these two claims are entirely inconsistent and in any event not supported by the facts” house democrats who have been in hot pursuit of mr trump’s tax returns most likely have no idea that at least some of the records are sitting in a congressional office building george yin a former chief of staff for the joint committee said that any identifying information about taxpayers under review was tightly held among a handful of staff lawyers and was rarely shared with politicians assigned to the committee it is possible that the case has been paused because mr trump is president which would raise the personal stakes of reelection if the recent fox interview is any indication mr trump seems increasingly agitated about the matter “it’s a disgrace what’s happened” he told mr hannity “we had a deal done in fact it was — i guess it was signed even and once i ran or once i won or somewhere back a long time ago everything was like ‘well let’s start all over again’ it’s a disgrace” the 20 percent solution helping to reduce mr trump’s tax bills are unidentified consultants’ fees some of which can be matched to payments received by ivanka trump examining the trump organization’s tax records a curious pattern emerges between 2010 and 2018 mr trump wrote off some 26 million in unexplained “consulting fees” as a business expense across nearly all of his projects in most cases the fees were roughly onefifth of his income in azerbaijan mr trump collected 5 million on a hotel deal and reported 11 million in consulting fees while in dubai it was 3 million with a 630000 fee and so on mysterious big payments in business deals can raise red flags particularly in places where bribes or kickbacks to middlemen are routine but there is no evidence that mr trump who mostly licenses his name to other people’s projects and is not involved in securing government approvals has engaged in such practices rather there appears to be a closertohome explanation for at least some of the fees mr trump reduced his taxable income by treating a family member as a consultant and then deducting the fee as a cost of doing business the “consultants” are not identified in the tax records but evidence of this arrangement was gleaned by comparing the confidential tax records to the financial disclosures ivanka trump filed when she joined the white house staff in 2017 ms trump reported receiving payments from a consulting company she coowned totaling 747622 that exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the trump organization for hotel projects in vancouver and hawaii eric ivanka and donald trump jr with their father at an announcement of the vancouver hotel project in 2013 ms trump appears to have both managed that deal and another in hawaii as a salaried trump organization executive and also been paid as a “consultant” on them jonathan haywardthe canadian press via associated press ms trump had been an executive officer of the trump companies that received profits from and paid the consulting fees for both projects — meaning she appears to have been treated as a consultant on the same hotel deals that she helped manage as part of her job at her father’s business when asked about the arrangement the trump organization lawyer mr garten did not comment employers can deduct consulting fees as a business expense and also avoid the withholding taxes that apply to wages to claim the deduction the consulting arrangement must be an “ordinary and necessary” part of running the business with fees that are reasonable and marketbased according to the irs the recipient of the fees is still required to pay income tax the irs has pursued civil penalties against some business owners who devised schemes to avoid taxes by paying exorbitant fees to related parties who were not in fact independent contractors a 2011 tax court case centered on the irs’s denial of almost 3 million in deductions for consulting fees the partners in an illinois accounting firm paid themselves via corporations they created the court concluded that the partners had structured the fees to “distribute profits not to compensate for services” there is no indication that the irs has questioned mr trump’s practice of deducting millions of dollars in consulting fees if the payments to his daughter were compensation for work it is not clear why mr trump would do it in this form other than to reduce his own tax liability another more legally perilous possibility is that the fees were a way to transfer assets to his children without incurring a gift tax a times investigation in 2018 found that mr trump’s late father fred trump employed a number of legally dubious schemes decades ago to evade gift taxes on millions of dollars he transferred to his children it is not possible to discern from this newer collection of tax records whether intrafamily financial maneuverings were a motivating factor however the fact that some of the consulting fees are identical to those reported by mr trump’s daughter raises the question of whether this was a mechanism the president used to compensate his adult children involved with his business indeed in some instances where large fees were claimed people with direct knowledge of the projects were not aware of any outside consultants who would have been paid on the failed hotel deal in azerbaijan which was plagued by suspicions of corruption a trump organization lawyer told the new yorker the company was blameless because it was merely a licenser and had no substantive role adding “we did not pay any money to anyone” yet the tax records for three trump llcs involved in that project show deductions for consulting fees totaling 11 million that were paid to someone in turkey a person directly involved in developing two trump towers in istanbul expressed bafflement when asked about consultants on the project telling the times there was never any consultant or other third party in turkey paid by the trump organization but tax records show regular deductions for consulting fees over seven years totaling 2 million ms trump disclosed in her public filing that the fees she received were paid through ttt consulting llc which she said provided “consulting licensing and management services for real estate projects” incorporated in delaware in december 2005 the firm is one of several trumprelated entities with some variation of ttt or tttt in the name that appear to refer to members of the trump family like her brothers donald jr and eric ms trump was a longtime employee of the trump organization and an executive officer for more than 200 trump companies that licensed or managed hotel and resort properties the tax records show that the three siblings had each drawn a salary from their father’s company — roughly 480000 a year jumping to about 2 million after mr trump became president — though ms trump no longer receives a salary what’s more mr trump has said the children were intimately involved in negotiating and managing his projects when asked in a 2011 lawsuit deposition whom he relied on to handle important details of his licensing deals he named only ivanka donald jr and eric on ms trump’s nowdefunct website which explains her role at the trump organization she was not identified as a consultant rather she has been described as a senior executive who “actively participates in all aspects of both trump and trump branded projects including deal evaluation predevelopment planning financing design construction sales and marketing and ensuring that trump’s worldrenowned physical and operational standards are met “she is involved in all decisions — large and small” the art of the writeoff hair stylists table linens property taxes on a family estate — all have been deducted as business expenses private jets country clubs and mansions have all had a role in the selling of donald trump “i play to people’s fantasies” he wrote in “trump the art of the deal” “people want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular i call it truthful hyperbole it’s an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion” if the singular trump product is trump in an exaggerated form — the man the lifestyle the acquisitiveness — then everything that feeds the image including the cost of his businesses can be written off on his taxes mr trump may be reporting business losses to the government but he can still live a life of wealth and write it off take for example maralago now the president’s permanent residence as well as a private club and stage set on which trump luxury plays out as a business it is also the source of millions of dollars in expenses deducted from taxable income among them 109433 for linens and silver and 197829 for landscaping in 2017 also deducted as a business expense was the 210000 paid to a florida photographer over the years for shooting numerous events at the club including a 2016 new year’s eve party hosted by mr trump maralago where a flood of new members starting in 2015 allowed mr trump to pocket an additional 5 million a year from the business is also a source of millions in tax deductions saul martinez for the new york times mr trump has written off as business expenses costs — including fuel and meals — associated with his aircraft used to shuttle him among his various homes and properties likewise the cost of haircuts including the more than 70000 paid to style his hair during “the apprentice” together nine trump entities have written off at least 95464 paid to a favorite hair and makeup artist of ivanka trump in allowing business expenses to be deducted the irs requires that they be “ordinary and necessary” a loosely defined standard often interpreted generously by business owners perhaps mr trump’s most generous interpretation of the business expense writeoff is his treatment of the seven springs estate in westchester county ny seven springs is a throwback to another era the main house built in 1919 by eugene i meyer jr the onetime head of the federal reserve who bought the washington post in 1933 sits on more than 200 acres of lush almost untouched land just an hour’s drive north of new york city “the mansion is 50000 square feet has three pools carriage houses and is surrounded by nature preserves” according to the trump organization website mr trump had big plans when he bought the property in 1996 — a golf course a clubhouse and 15 private homes but residents of surrounding towns thwarted his ambitions arguing that development would draw too much traffic and risk polluting the drinking water mr trump instead found a way to reap tax benefits from the estate he took advantage of what is known as a conservation easement in 2015 he signed a deal with a land conservancy agreeing not to develop most of the property in exchange he claimed a 211 million charitable tax deduction mr trump classified the seven springs estate as an investment property not a personal residence allowing for certain tax savings meanwhile eric trump has called it a “home base” and the trump organization website describes it as a “retreat for the trump family” tony cenicolathe new york times the tax records reveal another way seven springs has generated substantial tax savings in 2014 mr trump classified the estate as an investment property as distinct from a personal residence since then he has written off 22 million in property taxes as a business expense — even as his 2017 tax law allowed individuals to write off only 10000 in property taxes a year courts have held that to treat residences as businesses for tax purposes owners must show that they have “an actual and honest objective of making a profit” typically by making substantial efforts to rent the property and eventually generating income whether or not seven springs fits those criteria the trumps have described the property somewhat differently in 2014 eric trump told forbes that “this is really our compound” growing up he and his brother donald jr spent many summers there riding allterrain vehicles and fishing on a nearby lake at one point the brothers took up residence in a carriage house on the property “it was home base for us for a long long time” eric told forbes and the trump organization website still describes seven springs as a “retreat for the trump family” mr garten the trump organization lawyer did not respond to a question about the seven springs writeoff the seven springs conservationeasement deduction is one of four that mr trump has claimed over the years while his use of these deductions is widely known his tax records show that they represent the lion’s share of his charitable giving — about 1193 million of roughly 130 million in personal and corporate charitable contributions reported to the irs the trump national golf club in los angeles another site where mr trump has claimed a conservationeasement deduction bryan denton for the new york times two of those deductions — at seven springs and at the trump national golf club in los angeles — are the focus of an investigation by the new york attorney general who is examining whether the appraisals on the land and therefore the tax deductions were inflated another common deductible expense for all businesses is legal fees the irs requires that these fees be “directly related to operating your business” and businesses cannot deduct “legal fees paid to defend charges that arise from participation in a political campaign” yet the tax records show that the trump corporation wrote off as business expenses fees paid to a criminal defense lawyer alan s futerfas who was hired to represent donald trump jr during the russia inquiry investigators were examining donald jr’s role in the 2016 trump tower meeting with russians who had promised damaging information on mrs clinton when he testified before congress in 2017 mr futerfas was by his side mr futerfas was also hired to defend the president’s embattled charitable foundation which would be shut down in 2018 after new york regulators said it had engaged in “a shocking pattern of illegality” the trump corporation paid mr futerfas at least 19 million in 2017 and 2018 tax records show also written off was at least 259684 paid to williams jensen another law firm brought in during the same period to represent donald trump jr a president and a businessman deals in countries led by strongmen tenants who have business before the federal government and hotels and clubs that draw those seeking access or favor in may the chairman of a trade group representing turkish business interests wrote to commerce secretary wilbur ross urging support for increased trade between the united states and turkey the ultimate goal was nothing less than “reorienting the us supply chain away from china” the letter was among three sent to cabinet secretaries by mehmet ali yalcindag chairman of the turkeyus business council who noted that he had copied each one to mr trump the president needed no introduction to mr yalcindag the turkish businessman helped negotiate a licensing deal in 2008 for his family’s company to develop two trump towers in istanbul the tax records show the deal has earned mr trump at least 13 million — far more than previously known — including more than 1 million since he entered the white house even as his onetime associate now lobbies on behalf of turkish interests mr yalcindag said he had “remained friendly” with mr trump since their work together years ago but that all communications between his trade group and the administration “go through formal channels and are properly disclosed” mehmet ali yalcindag pictured with the trumps in 2012 helped negotiate a licensing deal in istanbul that brought mr trump at least 13 million he now lobbies on behalf of turkish business interests trump organization via pr newswire the ethical quandaries created by mr trump’s decision to keep his business while in the white house have been documented but the full financial measure of his extraordinary confluence of interests — a president with a wealth of business entanglements at home and in myriad geopolitical hot spots — has remained elusive the tax records for mr trump and his hundreds of companies show precisely how much money he has received over the years and how heavily he has come to rely on leveraging his brand in ways that pose potential or direct conflicts of interest while he is president the records also provide the first reliable window onto his finances before 2014 the earliest year covered by his required annual disclosures showing that his total profits from some projects outside the united states were larger than indicated by those limited public filings based on the financial disclosures which report much of his income in broad ranges mr trump’s earnings from the istanbul towers could have been as low as 32 million in the philippines where he licensed his name to a manila tower nearly a decade ago the low end of the range was 41 million — less than half of the 93 million he actually made in azerbaijan he collected more than 5 million for the failed hotel project about twice what appeared on his public filings it did not take long for conflicts to emerge when mr trump ran for president and won the philippines’ strongman leader rodrigo duterte chose as a special trade envoy to washington the businessman behind the trump tower in manila in argentina a key person who had been involved in a uruguayan licensing deal that earned mr trump 23 million was appointed to a cabinet post the president’s conflicts have been most evident with turkey where the business community and the authoritarian government of president recep tayyip erdogan have not hesitated to leverage various trump enterprises to their advantage when turkishamerican relations were at a low point a turkish business group canceled a conference at mr trump’s washington hotel six months later when the two countries were on better terms the rescheduled event was attended by turkish government officials turkish airlines also chose the trump national golf club in suburban virginia to host an event more broadly the tax records suggest other ways in which mr trump’s presidency has propped up his sagging bottom line monthly credit card receipts reported to the irs by thirdparty card processing firms reflect the way certain of his resorts golf courses and hotels became favored stomping grounds if not venues for influencetrading beginning in 2015 and continuing into his time in the white house the credit card data does not reflect total revenue and is useful mainly for showing shortterm ups and downs of consumer interest in a business while two of mr trump’s marquee draws — the washington hotel in the old post office and the doral golf resort — are loaded with debt and continue to lose money both have seen credit card transactions rise markedly with his political ascent though the trump international hotel in washington is loaded with debt and losing money its credit card transactions have risen with mr trump’s political ascent al drago for the new york times at the hotel the monthly receipts grew from 37 million in december 2016 shortly after it opened to 54 million in january 2017 and 6 million by may 2018 at doral after mr trump declared his candidacy in june 2015 credit card revenue more than doubled to 13 million for the three months through august compared with the same period the year before one trump enterprise that has been regularly profitable and is a persistent source of concern about ethical conflicts and national security lapses is the maralago club profits there rose sharply after mr trump declared his candidacy as courtiers eagerly joining up brought a tenfold rise in cash from initiation fees — from 664000 in 2014 to just under 6 million in 2016 even before mr trump doubled the cost of initiation in january 2017 the membership rush allowed the president to take 26 million out of the business from 2015 through 2018 nearly triple the rate at which he had paid himself in the prior two years some of the largest payments from business groups for events or conferences at maralago and other trump properties have come since mr trump became president the tax records show at doral mr trump collected a total of at least 7 million in 2015 and 2016 from bank of america and at least 12 million in 2017 and 2018 from a trade association representing food retailers and wholesalers the us chamber of commerce paid doral at least 406599 in 2018 beyond onetime payments for events or memberships large corporations also pay rent for space in the few commercial buildings mr trump actually owns walgreens the pharmacy giant that resolved an antitrust matter before federal regulators in 2017 pays 34 million a year for a lease at 40 wall street a trumpowned office building in manhattan another renter at 40 wall for 25 million a year is atane engineers which changed its name in 2018 after a corruption scandal that culminated in two former top executives’ pleading guilty to paying bribes for city infrastructure contracts despite the criminal case — which landed the company on new york state’s list of “nonresponsible entities” that require a waiver to obtain state contracts — the newly christened atane registered as an eligible federal contractor with no restrictions listed in its file rental income over all at 40 wall has risen markedly from 305 million in 2014 to 432 million in 2018 the tax records show that the cost of existing leases there has risen and at least four law firms appear to have moved in since mr trump ran for president mr trump has a 30 percent stake in two valuable office towers including one in midtown manhattan shared with and managed by vornado realty trust dave sanders for the new york times the other tower in san francisco coowned with vornado whose ceo is a trump ally and whose tenants include firms that lobby the federal government jim wilsonthe new york times in addition to buildings he owns outright there is the president’s stake in the vornado partnerships that control two valuable office towers — 1290 sixth avenue in manhattan and 555 california street in san francisco vornado’s chief executive steven roth is a close trump ally recently named to the white house economic recovery council last year the president appointed mr roth’s wife daryl roth to the kennedy center board of trustees vornado tenants include a roster of bluechip firms paying multimilliondollar leases many of whom regularly do business with lobby or are regulated by the federal government among the dozens of leases paid in 2018 to mr trump’s vornado partnerships according to his tax records were 58 million from goldman sachs 31 million from microsoft 327 million from neuberger berman an investment management company and 88 million from the law firm kirkland ellis the gathering storm threats are converging mounting business losses the looming irs audit and personally guaranteed debts coming due when mr trump glided down a gilded trump tower escalator to kick off his presidential campaign in june 2015 his finances needed a jolt his core businesses were reporting mounting losses — more than 100 million over the previous two years the river of celebritydriven income that had long buoyed them was running dry if mr trump hoped his unlikely candidacy might at least revitalize his brand his barrage of derogatory remarks about immigrants quickly cost him two of his biggest and easiest sources of cash — licensing deals with clothing and mattress manufacturers that had netted him more than 30 million nbc his partner in miss universe — source of nearly 20 million in profits — announced that it would no longer broadcast the pageant he sold it soon after now his tax records make clear that he is facing a battery of threats to his business and his own financial wellbeing over the past decade he appears to have filled the cashflow gaps with a series of oneshots that may not be available again in 2012 he took out a 100 million mortgage on the commercial space in trump tower he took nearly the entire amount as a payout his tax records show his company has paid more than 15 million in interest on the loan but nothing on the principal the full 100 million comes due in 2022 in 2013 he withdrew 958 million from his vornado partnership account and in january 2014 he sold 98 million in stocks and bonds his biggest single month of sales in at least the last two decades he sold 54 million more in stocks and bonds in 2015 and 682 million in 2016 his financial disclosure released in july showed that he had as little as 873000 in securities left to sell mr trump’s businesses reported cash on hand of 347 million in 2018 down 40 percent from five years earlier what’s more the tax records show that mr trump has once again done what he says he regrets looking back on his early 1990s meltdown personally guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in loans a decision that led his lenders to threaten to force him into personal bankruptcy this time around he is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling 421 million with most of it coming due within four years should he win reelection his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president there is however a tax benefit for mr trump while business owners can use losses to avoid taxes they can do so only up to the amount invested in the business but by taking personal responsibility for that 421 million in debt mr trump would be able to declare that amount in losses in future years the balances on those loans had not been paid down by the end of 2018 and the businesses carrying the bulk of the debt — the doral golf resort 125 million and the washington hotel 160 million — are struggling which could make it difficult to find a lender willing to refinance it the unresolved audit of his 729 million tax refund hangs over his head the broader economy promises little relief across the country brickandmortar stores are in decline and they have been very important to trump tower which has in turn been very important to mr trump nike which rented the space for its flagship store in a building attached to trump tower and had paid 1951 million in rent since the 1990s left in 2018 the president’s most recent financial disclosure reported modest gains in 2019 but that was before the pandemic hit his already struggling properties were shut down for several months earlier this year the doral resort asked deutsche bank to allow a delay on its loan payments analysts have predicted that the hotel business will not fully recover until late 2023 mr trump still has assets to sell but doing so could take its own toll both financial and to mr trump’s desire to always be seen as a winner the trump family said last year that it was considering selling the washington hotel but not because it was losing money in mr trump’s telling any difficulty in his finances has been caused by the sacrifices made for his current job “they say ‘trump is getting rich off our nation’” he said at a rally in minneapolis last october “i lose billions being president and i don’t care it’s nice to be rich i guess but i lose billions” david kirkpatrick kitty

enlarge this image toggle caption shuran huangnpr shuran huangnpr follow nprs coverage of ginsburgs death and the political aftermath here justice ruth bader ginsburg the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal cultural and feminist icon died friday the supreme court announced her death saying the cause was complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas the court in a statement said ginsburg died at her home in washington dc surrounded by family she was 87 our nation has lost a justice of historic stature chief justice john roberts said we at the supreme court have lost a cherished colleague today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember ruth bader ginsburg as we knew her a tireless and resolute champion of justice architect of the legal fight for womens rights in the 1970s ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nations highest court becoming its most prominent member her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her and it thrusts the supreme court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign just days before her death as her strength waned ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter clara spera my most fervent wish is that i will not be replaced until a new president is installed she knew what was to come ginsburgs death will have profound consequences for the court and the country inside the court not only is the leader of the liberal wing gone but with the court about to open a new term the chief justice no longer holds the controlling vote in closely contested cases though roberts has a consistently conservative record in most cases he has split from fellow conservatives in a few important ones this year casting his vote with liberals for instance to protect at least temporarily the socalled dreamers from deportation by the trump administration to uphold a major abortion precedent and to uphold bans on large church gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic but with ginsburg gone there is no clear court majority for those outcomes npr youtube upcoming political battle indeed a week after the upcoming presidential election the court is for the third time scheduled to hear a challenge brought by republicans to the affordable care act known as obamacare in 2012 the high court upheld the law in a 54 ruling with roberts casting the deciding vote and writing the opinion for the majority but this time the outcome may well be different thats because ginsburgs death gives republicans the chance to tighten their grip on the court with another appointment by president trump so conservatives would have 63 majority and that would mean that even a defection on the right would leave conservatives with enough votes to prevail in the obamacare case and many others at the center of the battle to achieve that will be senate majority leader mitch mcconnell in 2016 he took a step unprecedented in modern times he refused for nearly a year to allow any consideration of president barack obamas supreme court nominee back then mcconnells justification was the upcoming presidential election which he said would allow voters a chance to weigh in on what kind of justice they wanted but now with the tables turned mcconnell has made clear he will not follow the same course instead he will try immediately to push through a trump nominee so as to ensure a conservative justice to fill ginsburgs liberal shoes even if trump were to lose his reelection bid asked what he would do in circumstances

way the world is for american women for more than a decade until her first judicial appointment in 1980 she led the fight in the courts for gender equality when she began her legal crusade women were treated by law differently from men hundreds of state and federal laws restricted what women could do barring them from jobs rights and even from jury service by the time she donned judicial robes however ginsburg had worked a revolution that was never more evident than in 1996 when as a relatively new supreme court justice ginsburg wrote the courts 71 opinion declaring that the virginia military institute could no longer remain an allmale institution true ginsburg said most women — indeed most men — would not want to meet the rigorous demands of vmi but the state she said could not exclude women who could meet those demands reliance on overbroad generalizations estimates about the way most men or most women are will not suffice to deny opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description ginsburg wrote she was an unlikely pioneer a diminutive and shy woman whose soft voice and large glasses hid an intellect and attitude that as one colleague put it was tough as nails by the time she was in her 80s she had become something of a rock star to women of all ages she was the subject of a hit documentary a biopic an operetta merchandise galore featuring her notorious rbg moniker a time magazine cover and regular saturday night live sketches on one occasion in 2016 ginsburg got herself into trouble and later publicly apologized for disparaging remarks she made about thenpresidential candidate trump but for the most part ginsburg enjoyed her fame and maintained a sense of humor about herself asked about the fact that she had apparently fallen asleep during the 2015 state of the union address ginsburg did not take the fifth admitting that although she had vowed not to drink at dinner with the other justices before the speech the wine had just been too good to resist the result she said was that she was perhaps not an entirely sober judge and kept nodding off the road to law born in brooklyn ruth bader went to public schools where she excelled as a student — and as a baton twirler by all accounts it was her mother who was the driving force in her young life but celia bader died of cancer the day before the future justice would graduate from high school then 17 ruth bader went on to cornell university on a full scholarship where she met martin aka marty ginsburg what made marty so overwhelmingly attractive to me was that he cared that i had a brain she said after her graduation they were married and went off to fort sill okla for his military service there mrs ginsburg despite scoring high on the civil service exam could only get a job as a typist and when she became pregnant she lost even that job two years later the couple returned to the east coast to attend harvard law school she was one of only nine women in a class of more than 500 and found the dean asking her why she was taking up a place that should go to a man at harvard she was the academic star not her husband the couple were busy juggling schedules and their toddler when marty ginsburg was diagnosed with testicular cancer surgeries and aggressive radiation followed so that left ruth with a 3yearold child a fairly sick husband the law review classes to attend and feeding me marty ginsburg said in a 1993 interview with npr the experience also taught the future justice that sleep was a luxury during the year of her husbands illness he was only able to eat late at night after that he would dictate his senior class paper to her at about 2 am he would go back to sleep ruth bader ginsburg recalled in an npr interview then id take out the books and start reading what i needed to be prepared for classes the next day marty ginsburg survived graduated and got a job in new york his wife a year behind him in school transferred to columbia where she graduated at the top of her law school class despite her academic achievements the doors to law firms were closed to women and though recommended for a supreme court clerkship she wasnt even interviewed it was bad enough that she was a woman she recalled later but she was also a mother and male judges worried she would be diverted by her familial obligations a mentor law professor gerald gunther finally got her a clerkship in new york by promising judge edmund palmieri that if she couldnt do the work he would provide someone who could that was the carrot ginsburg would say later the stick was that gunther who regularly fed his best students to palmieri told the judge that if he didnt take ginsburg gunther would never send him a clerk again the ginsburg clerkship apparently was a success palmieri kept her not for the usual one year but two from 195961 ginsburgs next path is rarely talked about mainly because it doesnt fit the narrative she learned swedish so she could work with anders bruzelius a swedish civil procedure scholar through the columbia university school of law project on international procedure ginsburg and bruzelius coauthored a book in 1963 ginsburg finally landed a teaching job at rutgers law school where she at one point hid her second pregnancy by wearing her motherinlaws clothes the ruse worked her contract was renewed before her baby was born while at rutgers she began her work fighting gender discrimination the mother brief her first big case was a challenge to a law that barred a colorado man named charles moritz from taking a tax deduction for the care of his 89yearold mother the irs said the deduction by statute could only be claimed by women or widowed or divorced men but moritz had never married the tax court concluded that the internal revenue code was immune to constitutional challenge a notion that tax lawyer marty ginsburg viewed as preposterous the two ginsburgs took on the case — he from the tax perspective she from the constitutional one according to marty ginsburg for his wife this was the mother brief she had to think through all the issues and how to fix the inequity the solution was to ask the court not to invalidate the statute but to apply it equally to both sexes she won in the lower courts amazingly he recalled in a 1993 npr interview the government petitioned the us supreme court stating that the decision cast a cloud of unconstitutionality over literally hundreds of federal statutes and it attached a list of those statutes which it compiled with defense department computers those laws marty ginsburg added were the statutes that my wife then litigated to overturn over the next decade in 1971 she would write her first supreme court brief in the case of reed v reed ruth bader ginsburg represented sally reed who thought she should be the executor of her sons estate instead of her exhusband the constitutional issue was whether a state could automatically prefer men over women as executors of estates the answer from the allmale supreme court no it was the first time the court had struck down a state law because it discriminated based on gender and that was just the beginning enlarge this image toggle caption manuel balce cenetaap manuel balce cenetaap by then ginsburg was earning quite a reputation she would become the first female tenured professor at columbia law school and she would found the womens rights project at the american civil liberties union as the chief architect of the battle for womens legal rights ginsburg devised a strategy that was characteristically cautious precise and singlemindedly aimed at one goal winning knowing that she had to persuade male establishmentoriented judges she often picked male plaintiffs and she liked social security cases because they illustrated how discrimination against women can harm men for example in weinberger v wiesenfeld she represented a man whose wife the principal breadwinner died in childbirth the husband sought survivors benefits to care for his child but under the thenexisting social security law only widows not widowers were entitled to such benefits this absolute exclusion based on gender per se operates to the disadvantage of female workers their surviving spouses and their children ginsburg told the justices at oral argument the supreme court would ultimately agree as it did in five of the six cases she argued over the years ginsburg would file dozens of briefs seeking to persuade the courts that the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection applies not just to racial and ethnic minorities but to women as well in an interview with npr she explained the legal theory that she eventually sold to the supreme court the words of the 14th amendments equal protection clause — nor shall any state deny to any person the equal protection of the laws well that word any person covers women as well as men and the supreme court woke up to that reality in 1971 ginsburg said during these pioneering years ginsburg would often work through the night as she had during law school but by this time she had two children and she later liked to tell a story about the lesson she learned when her son in grade school seemed to have a proclivity for getting into trouble the scrapes were hardly major and ginsburg grew exasperated by demands from school administrators that she come in to discuss her sons alleged misbehavior finally there came a day when she had had enough i had stayed up all night the night before and i said to the principal this child has two parents please alternate calls after that she found the calls were few and far between it seemed she said that most infractions were not worth calling a busy husband about the supreme courts second woman in 1980 president jimmy carter named ginsburg to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit over the next 13 years she would amass a record as something of a centrist liberal and in 1993 president bill clinton nominated her to the supreme court the second woman appointed to the position she was not first on his list for months clinton flirted with other potential nominees and some womens rights activists withheld their active support because they were worried about ginsburgs views on abortion she had been publicly critical of the legal reasoning in roe v wade but in the background marty ginsburg was lobbying hard for his wife and finally ruth ginsburg was invited for a meeting with the president as one white house official put it afterward clinton fell for her — hook line and sinker so did the senate she was confirmed by a 963 vote once on the court ginsburg was an example of a woman who defied stereotypes though she looked tiny and frail she rode horses well into her 70s and even went parasailing at home it was her husband who was the chef indeed a master chef while the justice cheerfully acknowledged she was an awful cook though a liberal she and the courts conservative icon antonin scalia who died in 2016 were the closest of friends indeed an opera called scaliaginsburg is based on their legal disagreements and their affection for each other toggle caption susan walshap over the years as ginsburgs place on the court grew in seniority so did her role in 2006 as the court veered right after the retirement of justice sandra day oconnor ginsburg dissented more often and more assertively her most passionate dissents coming in womens rights cases dissenting in ledbetter v goodyear in 2007 she called on congress to pass legislation that would override a court decision that drastically limited back pay available for victims of employment discrimination the resulting legislation was the first bill passed in 2009 after obama took office in 2014 she dissented fiercely in burwell v hobby lobby a decision that allowed some forprofit companies to refuse on religious grounds to comply with a federal mandate to cover birth control in health care plans such an exemption she said would deny legions of women who do not hold their employers beliefs access to contraceptive coverage where she asked is the stopping point suppose it offends an employers religious belief to pay the minimum wage or to accord women equal pay and in 2013 when the court struck down a key provision of the voting rights act contending that times had changed and the law was no longer needed ginsburg dissented she said that throwing out the provision when it has worked and is continuing to work is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet she viewed her dissents as a chance to persuade a future court some of my favorite opinions are dissenting opinions ginsburg told npr i will not live to see what becomes of them but i remain hopeful and yet ginsburg still managed some unexpected victories by winning over one or two of the conservative justices in important cases in 2015 for example she authored the courts decision upholding independent redistricting commissions established by voter referenda as a way of removing some of the partisanship in drawing legislative district lines ginsburg always kept a backbreaking schedule of public appearances both at home and abroad even after five bouts with cancer colon cancer in 1999 pancreatic cancer 10 years later lung cancer in 2018 and then pancreatic cancer again in 2019 and liver lesions in 2020 during that time she endured chemotherapy radiation and in the last years of her life terrible pain from shingles that never went away completely all who knew her admired her grit in 2009 three weeks after major cancer surgery she surprised everyone when she showed up for the state of the union address shortly after that she was back on the bench it was her husband marty who told her she could do it even when she thought she could not she told npr a year later her psychological toughness was on full display when her beloved husband of 56 years was mortally ill as she packed up his things at the hospital before taking him home to die she found a note he had written to her my dearest ruth it began you are the only person i have ever loved setting aside children and family i have admired and loved you almost since the day we first met at cornell the time has come for me to take leave of life because the loss of quality simply overwhelms i hope you will support where i come out but i understand you may not i will not love you a jot less shortly after that marty ginsburg died at home the next day his wife the justice was on the bench reading an important opinion she had authored for the court she was there she said because marty would have wanted it years later she would read the letter aloud in an npr interview and at the end choke down the tears in the years after martys death she would persevere without him maintaining a jampacked schedule when she was not on the bench or working on opinions some liberals criticized her for not retiring while obama was president but she was at the top of her game enjoyed her work enormously and feared that republicans might not confirm a successor she was an avid consumer of opera literature and modern art but in the end it was her work she said that sustained her i do think that i was born under a very bright star she said in an npr interview because if you think about my life i get out of law school i have top grades no law firm in the city of new york will hire me i end up teaching it gave me time to devote to the movement for evening out the rights of women and men and it was that legal crusade for womens rights that ultimately led to her appointment to the us supreme court to the end of her tenure she remained a special kind of feminist both decorous and dogged

it became apparent that the former vice president had ousted president donald trump by securing the necessary 270 electoral votes the 26yearold navajo and tewa man was driving alongside his niece when he got the news surrounded by a parade of cheering drivers who were screaming and honking from their vehicles then once he saw the new mexico state flag beaming from his rear view mirror he decided to express his joy while also paying tribute to his heritage the new mexico state flag is actually a native american symbol and that symbol represents the sun to me seeing that flag waving represented the coming of a new day a new sun a new light trujillo told abc news the 21second clip of him dancing which has since garnered over five million views on twitter was captured in albuquerque new mexico by photojournalism student sharon chischilly she was in the area photographing the communitys reaction to the election results when she caught sight of trujillo the viral moment has fueled activists across social media to highlight how a recordhigh voter turnout among indigenous populations played a major role in key swing states especially in arizona and wisconsin where slim margins helped tip

the navajo nation registered to vote this year were local groups hosting horseback rides allie young the cofounder of protect the sacred is a 30yearold activist who has been leading efforts through an initiative titled ride to the polls we rode in honor of our ancestors who fought for our right to vote we rode in honor of our ancestors who rode longer miles and hours just to exercise their right to vote for us youngs group wrote about the effort on instagram in 1924 the indian citizenship act was enacted by congress which granted citizenship to all native americans born in the us the right to vote however wasnt governed by state law until 1957 with some states still barring native americans from voting they community faced obstacles similar to those black americans faced until the passage of the civil rights act of 1965 was passed according to the national constitution center harvill who works on special projects for voteamerica believes that native people have felt invisible for too long and are finally being given a longoverdue recognition for being an instrumental part of the population there has been decades of work done by community members on the ground to build the political infrastructure for native turnout and now were starting to see it in 2020 harvill said we are going to see this power continue to build trujillo said that hes proud of his community after all the hurdles theyve overcome with this moment only reigniting his hopes for a better future this shows the world that even though weve been pushed down we still decided to get back up we still

Biden",https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/08/31/as-trumps-popularity-slips-in-latest-military-times-poll-more-troops-say-theyll-vote-for-biden/,progress18,2231,93,the latest military times poll shows a continued decline in activeduty service members’ views of president donald trump and a slight but significant preference for former vice president joe biden in the upcoming november election among troops surveyed the results collected before the political conventions earlier this month appear to undercut claims from the president that his support among military members is strong thanks to big defense budget increases in recent years and promised moves to draw down troops from overseas conflict zones but the military times polls surveying activeduty troops in partnership with the institute for veterans and military families ivmf at syracuse university have seen a steady drop in troops’ opinion of the commander in chief since his election four years ago in the latest results — based on 1018 activeduty troops surveyed in late july and early august — nearly half of respondents 499 percent had an unfavorable view of the president compared to about 38 percent who had a favorable view questions in the poll had a margin of error of up to 2 percent among all survey participants 42 percent said they “strongly” disapprove of trump’s time in office the unfavorable number matches what an earlier military times poll found in late 2019 while the favorable total slipped from just under 42 percent last year in a poll conducted at the start of trump’s presidency 46 percent of troops had a favorable view of him versus 37 percent who had an unfavorable opinion × fear of missing out sign up for the early bird brief a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe thanks for signing up by giving us your email you are opting in to the early bird brief even with the steady decline trump’s popularity in the poll remains better than former president barack obama obama had a 36 percent favorable rating and a 52 percent unfavorable rating in a january 2017 military times poll still the dipping popularity among troops — considered by republican party leaders to be part of the base of trump’s support — could prove problematic for the president in the upcoming election among activeduty service members surveyed in the poll 41 percent said they would vote for biden the democratic nominee if the election was held today only 37 percent said they plan to vote to reelect trump another 13 percent said they plan to vote for a thirdparty candidate and nearly 9 percent said they plan on skipping the election altogether about 40 percent of troops surveyed identified as republican or libertarian 16 percent democrats and 44 percent independent or another party “it’s fair to say that trump is not as popular as republican nominees have been in the past among this group” said peter feaver a white house adviser to former president george w bush who now works as a political science professor at duke university “the bottom line is that in 2020 trump can’t be claiming to have overwhelming support in the military” poll limitations rosalinda maury director of applied research at ivmf said the poll serves as an important reminder that the military — much like the rest of the country — is made up of a large collection of different experiences and perspectives “we do see consistencies from poll to poll aspects of national security that may be more of a focus for a military audience” she said “but the military is not a homogenous population you do see a variety of opinions especially within subsets of the military” but she noted the poll which has been administered in the same way for the past four years is not a perfect snapshot of public opinion within the entire military force the average age of poll respondents was nearly 39 years and the participant pool was culled and verified from military times subscriber lists and databases feaver said the poll “is a good sample of the careeroriented military members’ views which may be different from the junior enlisted view of things” “but the president claims he has been good for the military that they’re grateful that he has rescued them from the shambles this shows that’s not the case with all of the military” the splits between officer and enlisted views within the poll are notable more than 59 percent of officers said they have a poor view of the president with more than half saying they strongly disapprove among enlisted respondents 47 percent said they have an unfavorable view and nearly 39 percent a favorable view enlisted views of trump’s performance in office have consistently been more favorable than those of officers in the poll over the last four years feaver said that could be due to officers’ predisposition to longterm military careers and a negative reaction to trump’s comments against the “deep state” and other career federal positions the national gallup poll of trump’s job performance conducted just before the political conventions found that 55 percent of americans had a negative view of the president against 42 percent who approved of his work feaver said with any poll of service members it is important to remember that those broader public views also play a factor “the military tends to follow broad shifts in the opinion of the american public albeit trending more conservative” he said “so as the country moves away from trump you’ll see that in the military too” policy disagreements even with the president’s lower popularity the most recent poll respondents were more likely to hold a favorable view of trump’s handling of military issues 48 percent than an unfavorable one 46 percent still the latest poll found significant disagreement among activeduty respondents with several controversial presidential policy statements from recent months only about 17 percent of those surveyed felt the white house has properly handled reports that russian officials offered bounties for afghan fighters to target and kill american troops an issue trump has dismissed as unreliable intelligence nearly 47 percent disagreed with his statements similarly almost 74 percent of those surveyed disagreed with trump’s suggestion that activeduty military personnel should be used to respond to civil unrest in american cities including the ongoing racial equality protests only about 22 percent supported the president’s idea that contrasts with half of the polls respondents’ support for using national guard troops to help address civil unrest connected to the protests troops agreed with trump’s assessment of china as a national security threat nearly 87 percent called it a significant concern but ranked russia 81 percent well above iran 58 percent only about 21 percent of troops saw immigration as a significant national security issue but 48 percent identified white nationalists as a concern nearly half of troops surveyed said the us military force level in germany should remain the same despite trump’s recent moves to drawn down american military personnel levels there another 24 percent say they believe troop levels in germany should be increased election views feaver said those policy disagreements “do not necessarily show that troops are beginning to think more like democrats but instead that they aren’t thinking like trump republicans” he also cautioned that the stronger support for biden in the poll than trump may be more a reflection of dissatisfaction with the president than a political shift within the ranks still he called the numbers showing a close race in military voting between the two surprising in the 2016 military times poll nearly twice as many respondents said they planned to vote for trump than then democratic nominee hillary clinton exit polls from the election showed a similar margin after election day a 2012 military times reader survey — conducted in a nonscientific fashion — showed respondents favoring then republican presidential nominee mitt romney by a 25to1 margin maury noted that the poll results are “a snapshot in a point of time” and that voting views can still shift in the two months between now and the election in the 2016 military times poll conducted in october about 34 percent of troops surveyed said they planned to vote for a thirdparty candidate instead of either trump or clinton exit polls after the election showed that only about 5 percent of veterans and military members cast votes for candidates who weren’t one of the two major party nominees our methodology between july 27 and aug 10 military times in collaboration with the institute for veterans and military families at syracuse university conducted a voluntary confidential online survey of us service members poll participants are readers of military times publications whose military status is verified through official defense department email addresses the survey included about 30 questions on service members’ opinions related to the current political climate policy and national security in the united states the survey received 1018 responses from activeduty troops the ivmf used standard methodology to weight the results according to the rank gender and service branch of the actual us military the margin of error for most questions was less than 2 percent like most studies where participation is voluntary the poll’s sample is subject to selfselection bias researchers sought to account for that and adhered to generally accepted scientific practices analyzing the data the survey audience was 93 percent male and 7 percent female the respondents identified themselves as 82 percent white 5 percent hispanic 6 percent african american 2 percent asian and 6 percent other ethnicities respondents were able to select more than one race the military times and the researchers at ivmf have used identical methodologies for this survey since 2016 editor’s note in two graphics accompanying our story on the military times poll results two digits in the graphics concerning troops’ voting preferences for the november election were transposed the poll results show 413 percent of individuals surveyed said they would vote for biden not 431 percent the graphics have been updated to reflect the correct numbers the copy in the story remains unchanged and reflects the accurate numbers

vice president joe biden is seen in a video feed from delaware with his wife jill biden and his grandchildren at his side after winning the votes to become the democratic partys 2020 nominee for president during the second night of the virtual 2020 democratic national convention in milwaukee wisc tuesday aug 18 2020 brian snyderpool via ap wilmington del ap — democrats formally nominated joe biden as their presidential candidate tuesday night with party elders a new generation of politicians and voters in every state joining together in an extraordinary pandemiccramped virtual convention to send him into the general election campaign to oust president donald trump for someone who has spent more than three decades eyeing the presidency the moment was the realization of a longsought goal but it played out in a way that the 77yearold biden couldn’t have imagined just months ago as the coronavirus pandemic prompted profound change across the country and in his presidential campaign advertisement instead of a milwaukee convention hall as initially planned the roll call of convention delegates played out in a combination of live and recorded video feeds from american landmarks packed with meaning alabama’s edmund pettus bridge the headwaters of the mississippi river a puerto rican community still recovering from a hurricane and washington’s black lives matter plaza biden celebrated his new status as the democratic nominee alongside his wife and grandchildren in a delaware school library his wife of more than 40 years jill biden later spoke of her husband in deeply personal terms reintroducing the lifelong politician as a man of deep empathy faith and resilience to american voters less than three months before votes are counted “there are times when i couldn’t imagine how he did it — how he put one foot in front of the other and kept going” she said “but i’ve always understood why he did it he does it for you” the convention’s most highly anticipated moments will unfold on the next two nights kamala harris will accept her nomination as biden’s running mate on wednesday the first black woman to join a major party ticket former president barack obama will also speak as part of his steppedup efforts to defeat his successor biden will deliver his acceptance speech thursday night in a mostly empty convention hall near his delaware home biden used the second night of the fourday convention to feature a mix of party elders republican as well as democratic to make the case that he has the experience and energy to repair chaos that trump has created at home and abroad former president bill clinton and former secretary of state john kerry — and former republican secretary of state colin powell — were among the heavy hitters on a schedule that emphasized a simple theme leadership matters former president jimmy carter now 95 years old also made a brief appearance advertisement some of them delivered attacks against trump that were unusually personal all in an effort to establish biden as the competent moral counter to the president “donald trump inherited a growing economy and a more peaceful world” kerry said “and like everything else he inherited he bankrupted it when this president goes oversees it isn’t a goodwill mission it’s a blooper reel” clinton said trump’s oval office is a place of chaos not a command center “if you want a president who defines the job as spending hours a day watching tv and zapping people on social media he’s your man” clinton said for his part trump spent tuesday courting battleground voters in an effort to distract from biden’s convention appearing in arizona near the mexican border during the day the republican president claimed a biden presidency would trigger “a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen” such divisive rhetoric which is not supported by biden’s positions has become a hallmark of trump’s presidency which has inflamed tensions at home and alienated allies around the world biden has the support of a sprawling political coalition as demonstrated again during tuesday’s convention although neither history nor enthusiasm is on his side just one incumbent president has been defeated since 1992 and biden’s supporters consistently report that they’re motivated more by opposition to trump than excitement about biden a collection of younger democrats including former georgia lawmaker stacey abrams and new york rep alexandria ocasiocortez were given a few minutes to shine but overall there was little room on tuesday’s program for the younger stars of the party’s farleft wing “in a democracy we do not elect saviors we cast our ballots for those who see our struggles and pledge to serve” said abrams 46 who emerged as a national player during her unsuccessful bid for governor in 2018 and was among those considered to be biden’s running mate for a second night the democrats featured republicans powell who served as secretary of state under george w bush and appeared at multiple republican conventions in years past endorsed the democratic candidate he joined the wife of the late arizona sen john mccain cindy mccain who stopped short of a formal endorsement but spoke in a video of the mutual respect and friendship her husband and biden shared while there have been individual members of the opposing party featured at presidential conventions before a half dozen republicans including the former twoterm governor of ohio have now spoken for democrat biden the democrats’ party elders played a prominent role throughout the night clinton who turns 74 on tuesday hasn’t held office in two decades kerry 76 was the democratic presidential nominee back in 2004 when the youngest voters this fall were still in diapers and carter is 95 years old biden’s team did not give the night’s coveted keynote address to a single fresh face preferring instead to pack the slot with more than a dozen democrats in their 20s 30s and 40s the younger leaders included abrams rep conor lamb dpa and the president of the navajo nation jonathan nez it remains to be seen whether the unconventional convention will give biden the momentum he’s looking for preliminary estimates show that television viewership for the first night of the virtual convention was down compared with the opening of hillary clinton’s onsite nominating party four years ago an estimated 187 million people watched coverage between 10 and 11 pm on abc cbs nbc cnn fox news channel and msnbc the nielsen company said four years ago the opening night drew just under 26 million viewers biden’s campaign said an additional 102 million streamed the convention online monday night “we are producing a digital convention and people are watching” biden spokesman tj ducklo tweeted price reported from las vegas and peoples reported from new york ap washington bureau chief julie pace contributed to this report

The_Donald",https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/reddit-bans-hate-speech-groups-removes-2000-subreddits-donald-trump-1234692898/,progress18,1658,144,reddit first launched as an online discussion site in june 2005 now 15 years later it has finally taken action to officially ban hate speech and groups that promote it a revised reddit content policy announced monday explicitly states that groups or users that “incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability” are prohibited “everyone has a right to use reddit free of harassment bullying and threats of violence” it says with the updated content policy reddit is initially banning about 2000 subreddits most of which are inactive the company said included in the purge is thedonald a prodonald trump forum notorious for users posting racist misogynistic antiislam and antisemitic content at one point thedonald had nearly 800000 active users in 2015 reddit adopted a new content policy and banned several blatantly racist subreddits but until today the official rules still did not explicitly forbid hate or racist forums reddit ceocofounder steve huffman in an post about the new policy said “i admit we have fallen short” in supporting the site’s communities and moderators with respect to adopting a comprehensive antihate policy “we are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors abusive behaviors and toxic communities that undermine our mission and exist solely to get in the way of the creativity discussions and communities that bring us all to reddit in the first place” huffman wrote reddit provided examples of hateful activities that would violate the rule a post describing a racial minority as subhuman and inferior to the racial majority a post arguing that rape of women should be acceptable and not a crime a meme saying it is sickening that people of color have the right to vote a subreddit group dedicated to mocking people with physical disabilities “all communities on reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith” huffman wrote the company banned thedonald “because it has not done so despite every opportunity the community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rulebreaking content than average” as well as “antagonized us and other communities” the smaller chapotraphouse was banned for similar reasons both thedonald and chapotraphouse already had been “quarantined” by the site in 2019 according to reddit that means they were “restricted due to significant issues with reporting and addressing violations of reddit’s rules against violence and other aspects of the content policy” reddit’s quarantining penalty puts a warning in front of subreddits prevents them from generating revenue and excludes their posts from appearing in search and recommendations of the 2000 subreddits removed for hate speech only 10 have more than 10 active daily users according to reddit the 10 most active groups among those banned in addition to thedonald and chapotraphouse are darkhumorandmemes consumeproduct darkjokecentral gendercritical cumtown imgoingtohellforthis2 wojak and soyboys the latest move by reddit comes after years of critics calling for the site crack down on hate speech and amid nationwide protests for racial justice after the police killing of george floyd earlier this month reddit cofounder alexis ohanian resigned from the board and urged reddit to select a black candidate to replace him five days later reddit named michael seibel a black venturecapital investor and adviser to the board of directors in ohanian’s place the new reddit policy banning hate speech defines “marginalized or vulnerable groups” as including those “based on their actual and perceived race color religion national origin ethnicity immigration status gender gender identity sexual orientation pregnancy or disability” it also specifically includes “victims of a major violent event and their families” such as parents of kids killed the 2012 mass shooting at connecticut’s sandy hook elementary school who have been targeted by rightwing conspiracy theorists bizarrely claiming the attack was a hoax however according to reddit the hatespeech ban “does not protect all groups or all forms of identity” the site says for example that “the rule does not protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate” reddit’s updated content policy also spells out a new requirement that users “abide by community rules” asking them to as huffman put it “post with authentic personal interest” the rule prohibits activity intended to “cheat or engage in content manipulation” in a subreddit including spamming vote manipulation ban evasion or subscriber fraud as well as anything else to “interfere with or disrupt reddit communities” reddit said it averaged more than 430 million monthly visitors and 21 billion monthly page views as of the end of 2019

august in south florida so it was too hot to cheer but you could feel it this sense” that feeling stretches beyond the jamaicanamerican community and the more traditional african american community shared by those in south florida with roots in haiti the bahamas trinidad and tobago or guyana they comprise a growing and varied black west indian diaspora community a littlediscussed but increasingly influential slice of the electorate of the nation’s biggest swing state while exact numbers are hard to come by census estimates and political studies peg the diverse black community — nicknamed the caribbean massive by some — at more than 25 million including hundreds of thousands of florida voters that’s crucial in a battleground state where elections are often decided by less than a percentage point for a campaign thats been dogged by questions of lackluster enthusiasm since biden declared his candidacy 16 months ago the electricity sparked by the harris pick has produced tangible results the campaign reported raising a record 48 million in 48 hours pollsters logged an uptick of support for biden who was already leading donald trump — including in the president’s mustwin state “it’s the pick that’s going to energize us it’s the pick that’s getting us motivated” said karen andre one of biden’s top advisers in florida who’s of haitianamerican descent she said the campaign plans “a full 360 degree effort” to engage caribbeanamerican voters including with paid radio ads in creole and english and possible interviews with harris with local hosts who have audiences with roots in the west indies andre said that after the harris announcement her phone was “burning” with calls from jamaicanamericans and also “heard from haiti trinidad barbados bahamas” at the same time the independent bidenbacking super pac unite the country is considering its own program aimed at black caribbean voters the pac is led by veteran florida operative steve schale who noticed a drop off in enthusiasm among these voters when hillary clinton unexpectedly lost the state to trump in 2016 even republicans acknowledge harris could have an effect “there is a very tight connection between haitian americans in south florida and jamaican americans in south florida” said hans mardy a haitianamerican republican activist from miami “we are one when it comes to our struggle we fought the same war we have the same bible what is good for one immigrant is good for us all” mardy like many haitianamericans said he’s struggling to support trump after he called the island a “shithole” democrats are determined not to let the community forget about it or trump’s hardline immigration policies that have particular salience in south florida mardy said his three adult daughters are all excited about voting for biden with harris on the ticket another creole plus for harris her campaign’s chief of staff is a wellknown daughter of the community karine jeanpierre eddy edwards host of the popular “caribbean riddims” am radio show for 36 years in broward said “there’s a buzz in the air” over harris still there isn’t perfect alignment between the haitian and jamaican diaspora communities in the state the haitian community is larger has a creolespeaking culture and is clustered more in north miamidade county jamaicanamericans’ ancestral island is a former english colony and they’ve made broward county their home clustering heavily in cities like lauderhill and miramar where the entire city council and mayor have jamaican ancestry nine months ago dale holness became the first jamaicanborn mayor of broward the secondmost populous in the state the west indian influence in broward county is so strong that the international cricket council sanctioned a new fort lauderdale stadium the project manager is chandradath singh a broward resident who was trinidad and tobago’s consul in miami before serving as the nation’s ambassador to india and china singh estimated florida has more than 2 million people with roots in the englishspeaking west indies and harris’ indian ancestry on her mother’s side gives her added salience in the caribbean many indians were brought to the west indies as indentured servants after slavery ended “biden’s history as vice president for barack obama was wellreceived by the community but now i see greater enthusiasm and support” singh said dan smith a university of florida professor studied the state’s voter rolls in 2018 and found there were at least 115000 florida voters born in haiti and 91000 born in jamaica the total number of us born voters who identify as haitianamerican jamaicanamerican or trace roots to other islands in the west indies is likely far higher the nonprofit migration policy institute estimates there are at least 336000 members of the jamaican diaspora community in florida 528000 haitianamericans 56000 with roots in trinidad and 7000 barbadian diaspora members the focus on these black voters and communities broadens the discussion of florida’s voters from the caribbean which usually focuses most heavily on those with roots in spanishspeaking cuba and puerto rico levi williams a republican activist and former school board candidate who’s of jamaican descent said that while black voters tend to vote democratic there’s a conservative group of voters who don’t like biden’s politics williams acknowledged that harris could drive higher turnout among black caribbeanamerican voters but he was skeptical the biden campaign would pull it off he pointed out that biden suggested recently that there was little diversity in the africanamerican community “caribbeans don’t consider themselves black in the american sense” williams said “a jamaican is a jamaican a haitian is a haitian and a trinidadian is a trinidadian you can’t place on that community the black experience in america” but marlon hill a miamidade county commission candidate said he considers himself africanamerican and jamaican he said harris who attended historically black howard university and was a member of the alpha kappa alpha sorority “appeals to the broadest definition of blackness in america in 2020 when you think of someone who is black you can think of their heritage of the state that they’re from and you have to think of their parents or the school that they went to being black is not singular in america in 2020” karen green chair of the florida democratic party’s diversity and inclusion committee said harris’ background creates a stark contrast with trump “she’s a universal woman of our modern times she serves as a woman who refutes everything trump stands for” green said “i’m going to be an evangelist for her and there are thousands like me”

ap photomatt rourke file file in this march 12 2020 file photo democratic presidential candidate former vice president joe biden speaks about the coronavirus in wilmington del biden has won the last few delegates he needed to clinch the democratic nomination for president ap photomatt rourke file washington ap — joe biden formally clinched the democratic presidential nomination friday setting him up for a bruising challenge to president donald trump that will play out against the unprecedented backdrop of a pandemic economic collapse and civil unrest “it was an honor to compete alongside one of the most talented groups of candidates the democratic party has ever fielded” biden said in a statement friday night ”and i am proud to say that we are going into this general election a united party” the former vice president has effectively been his party’s leader since his last challenger in the democratic primary bernie sanders ended his campaign in april but biden pulled together the 1991 delegates needed to become the nominee after seven states and the district of columbia held presidential primaries tuesday advertisement biden reached the threshold three days after the primaries because several states overwhelmed by huge increases in mail ballots took days to tabulate results a team of analysts at the associated press then parsed the votes into individual congressional districts democrats award most delegates to the party’s national convention based on results in individual congressional districts biden now has 1995 delegates with contests still to come in eight states and three us territories the moment was met with little of the traditional fanfare as the nation confronts overlapping crises while biden has started to venture out more this week the coronavirus pandemic has largely confined him to his wilmington delaware home for much of the past three months the country faces the worst rate of unemployment since the great depression and civil unrest that harkens back to the 1960s has erupted in dozens of cities following the death of george floyd a black man who died when a white minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air it’s a confluence of events that no us leader has faced in modern times made all the more complicated by a president who has at times antagonized the protesters and is eager to take the fight to biden “this is a difficult time in america’s history” biden said friday night “and donald trump’s angry divisive politics is no answer the country is crying out for leadership leadership that can unite us leadership that can bring us together” advertisement biden spent 36 years in the senate before becoming barack obama’s vice president this is 77yearold biden’s third bid for the presidency and his success in capturing the democratic nomination was driven by strong support from black voters he finished an embarrassing fourth place in the overwhelmingly white iowa caucuses that kicked off the nomination process in february biden fared little better in the new hampshire primary where his standing was so low that he left the state before polls closed on election night to instead rally black voters in south carolina his rebound began in the more diverse caucuses in nevada but solidified in south carolina where biden stomped sanders his nearest rival by nearly 29 points he followed that with a dominant showing three days later during the super tuesday contests taking 10 of the 14 states biden’s strong showing in states such as north carolina virginia tennessee and texas reinforced his status as the preferred democratic candidate of african american voters — but the relationship has not been without its strained moments after a tense exchange with an influential black radio host biden took sharp criticism for suggesting that african american voters still deciding between him and trump “ain’t black” that comment and protests that have spread nationwide have increased pressure on biden to pick an african american running mate he has already committed to picking a woman as a vice presidential candidate black voters are unlikely to back trump over biden by a wide margin a recent fox news poll shows just 14 of african americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of the president compared with 75 who favorably view biden but biden must ensure that black voters are motivated to show up to the polls in november especially in critical swing states that narrowly went for trump in 2016 at one point the democratic primary included dozens of candidates of different races genders and generations and an openly gay man the contest was dominated by debate over unapologetically progressive ideas including fully governmentfunded health care under “medicare for all” and a sweeping proposal to combat climate change known as the “green new deal” biden prevailed by mostly offering more moderate approaches that he argued would make him more electable against trump he refused to budge on his rejection of universal health care and some of the green new deal’s most ambitious provisions to combat climate change since clinching the nomination however biden has worked to build his appeal among progressives forming joint task forces with sanders’ campaign to find common ground on key issues like health care the economy and the environment biden has also embraced a plan to forgive millions of americans’ student debt meaning that he clinches the nomination as easily the most liberal standard bearer the democratic party has ever had biden’s embrace of his party’s left flank could help him consolidate a democratic base that remained deeply divided after the 2016 primary and ultimately hurt hillary clinton in her defeat to trump but it could also undermine biden’s attempts to rebuild the obama coalition which is often loosely defined as minorities and young people as well as educated americans and some workingclass voters the former vice president has sought since announcing his candidacy to cast the election as a battle “for the soul of the nation” and promised to restore order and dignity to the white house while rehabilitating the us image on the world stage such an approach though necessarily focuses on being more of an alternative to trump than offering radically new political ideas and that further underscores biden’s difficult task of trying to unite his party’s base while appealing to voters from far beyond it “i am going to spend every day between now and november 3rd fighting to earn the votes of americans all across this great country” biden promised friday “so that together we can win the battle for the soul of this nation and make sure that as we rebuild our economy everyone comes along”

incumbent since 1932678 the election saw the highest voter turnout since 19009 with each ticket receiving more than 73 million votes surpassing barack obamas record of 695 million votes from 2008

scheduled to be formally cast by the presidential electors on december 14 2020 and officially counted by congress on january 6 202112 trump secured the republican nomination without serious opposition

election included the public health and economic impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic civil unrest in reaction to the killing of george floyd and others the us supreme court following the death of ruth bader ginsburg and confirmation of amy coney barrett and the future of the affordable care act13 the election saw a record number of ballots cast early and by mail due to the ongoing pandemic14 as a result of the large number of mailin ballots some swing states saw delays in vote counting and reporting this led to major news outlets delaying their projection of biden and harris as the winners until november 7 four days after the election15 major media networks project a state for a candidate once there is high mathematical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning that state16 before during and after election day trump and numerous republicans attempted to subvert the election and overturn the results alleging that there had been widespread voter fraud and trying to influence the vote counting process in swing states171819 officials in all 50 states stated that there was no evidence of systematic fraud or irregularities in their state20 federal agencies overseeing election security said it was the most secure in american history212223 attorney general bill barr has also concluded that there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the election24252627 on multiple occasions trump falsely declared himself to be the winner2829 the trump campaign and its allies engaged in numerous attempts to overturn the results of the election by filing dozens of legal challenges in several states most of which were dropped or dismissed by various courts3031 spreading conspiracy theories falsely alleging fraud pressuring republican state electors and refusing to cooperate with the presidential transition for over two weeks32 although major media outlets called the election for biden on november 7 emily w murphy who as the head of the general services administration gsa is in charge of managing the presidential transition process for the outgoing administration refused to officially acknowledge biden as the presidentelect initially which meant that the official transition process could not start33 on november 23 the gsa officially acknowledged biden and harris as the winners and said the trump administration would begin the formal transition process trump then said he had instructed his administration to do what needs to be done but indicated he has not conceded and intended to continue his fight to overturn the election results34 biden and harris are scheduled to be inaugurated on january 20 2021 background procedure article two of the united states constitution states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a naturalborn citizen of the united states at least 35 years old and have been a united states resident for at least 14 years candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties of the united states each party develops a method such as a primary election to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position the primary elections are usually indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate the partys delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the partys behalf the presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that partys ticket which is then ratified by the delegates at the partys convention with the exception of the libertarian party which nominates its vicepresidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominees preference the general election in november is also an indirect election in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the electoral college these electors then directly elect the president and vice president35 if no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election the united states house of representatives will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes and the united states senate will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals the election will occur simultaneously alongside elections for the house of representatives senate and various state and locallevel elections the maine legislature passed a bill in august 2019 adopting rankedchoice voting rcv both for presidential primaries and for the general election3637 governor janet mills allowed the bill to become law without her signature which delayed it from taking effect until after the 2020 democratic primary in march but made maine the first state to use rcv for a presidential general election the maine republican party filed signatures for a veto referendum and preclude the use of rcv for the 2020 election but secretary of state matthew dunlap found there were insufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot a challenge in maine superior court was successful for the maine republican party but the maine supreme judicial court3839 stayed the ruling pending appeal on september 8 202040 nevertheless ballots began being printed later that day without the veto referendum and including rcv for the presidential election4142 and the court ruled in favor of the secretary of state on september 22 allowing rcv to be used43 an emergency appeal to the us supreme court was denied on october 644 implementation of rcv could potentially delay the projection of the winners of maines electoral votes for days after election day45 and may complicate interpretation of the national popular vote46 the law continues the use of the congressional district method for the allocation of maines electors nebraska is the only other state that apportions its electoral votes this way47 on december 14 2020 pledged electors for each candidate known collectively as the united states electoral college will gather in their states capital to cast their official ballot the ballots are sent to congress to be opened and officially counted pursuant to the processes laid out by the electoral count act of 1887 the newly elected congress will meet in joint session to open count and certify the ballots on january 6 2021 with the sitting vice president in his role as president of the senate presiding over the session demographic trends a bipartisan report indicated in 2019 that changes in voter demographics since the 2016 election could impact the results of the 2020 election african americans hispanics asians and other ethnic minorities as well as whites with a college degree are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020 while whites without a college degree will decrease the hispanic likely voter population has increased by approximately 600000 since the 2016 election48 generation z those born after 1996 will more than double to 10 of the eligible voters49 it was possible trump could win the electoral college while still losing the popular vote however updated nbc news reporting from september 2020 predicted this was unlikely with 2020 demographics5051 youth turnout in the 2016 presidential election was extremely low5253 and during the democratic primaries young voters broke overwhelmingly for bernie sanders5455 however polls suggest that youth turnout for the 2020 election is comparatively very high565758 the brookings institution released a report entitled exit polls show both familiar and new voting blocs sealed bidens win on november 12 2020 in it author william h frey attributes obamas 2008 win to young people people of color and the college educated frey contends trump won in 2016 thanks to older whites without college degrees59 frey says that the same coalitions largely held in 2008 and 2016 although in key battleground states biden increased his vote among some of the 2016 trump groups particularly among whites and older americans59 trump won the white vote in 2016 by 20 but in 2020 by only 17 the democratic party won black voters by 75 the lowest margin since 2004 democrats won the latino vote by 33 which was lower than the 2004 margin and they won the asian american vote by 27 the lowest figure since 200859 biden increased the democratic share of white men without college educations from 42 to 48 in 2016 and he made a slight improvement of 2 among white collegeeducated women people age 18 to 29 registered a rise in democratic support between 2016 and 2020 with the democratic margin of victory among that demographic increasing from 19 to 2459 voting patterns by ethnicity latinos voto latino says the latino vote was crucial to the biden victory in arizona 40 of latino voters who voted in 2020 did not vote in 2016 and 73 of latino voters voted for biden 438000 voters60 others note that the failure of democrats to win in florida and texas was because of the biden campaigns treatment of latinos as a monolithic voting bloc while democrats won most latino voters in both of these states they failed to win over cuban american voters in miamidade county florida and fourthandfifth generation englishspeaking tejanos in south texas at the rates they had in the past61 even in nevada which biden won he failed to do as well among hispanics as bernie sanders had done in the february caucus largely because sanders asked for their vote but biden did not61 however without latino support biden would have failed to carry the state62 demographic patterns emerged having to do with country of origin and candidate preference pre and postelection surveys showed biden winning latinos of mexican puerto rican dominican63 and spanish heritage64 while trump carried latinos of cuban heritage data from florida showed biden holding a narrow edge among south americans65 black voters biden won 90 of the black vote and his total votes among blacks even exceeded that of barack obama in 2008 this vote was crucial in the large cities of pennyslvania and michigan the increase in the democratic vote in milwaukee county of about 28000 votes was more than the 20000vote lead biden had in the state of wisconsin almost half of bidens gains in georgia came from the four largest counties—fulton dekalb gwinnett and cobb—all in the atlanta metro area with large black populations66 asian american and pacific island voters polls showed that 58 to 68 of asian american and pacific island voters aapi voters supported bidenharris while 28 to 40 supported trumppence from all of the data that we’ve seen it’s safe to say asian americans supported biden over trump backing democrats at a roughly 21 ratio says karthick ramakrishnan a political science professor at the university of california riverside and founder of aapi data however this overall tendency overlooks differences among particular ethnic groups korean americans japanese americans indian americans and chinese americans favored biden by higher margins overall compared to groups including vietnamese americans and filipino americans many voters were turned off by trumps racist language china virus and kung flu but others appreciated his strong antichina stance many indian americans selfidentified with kamala harris but others approved of donald trumps antimuslim rhetoric and support of indian prime minister narendra modi67 chinese american entrepreneur andrew yang and american samoaborn congresswoman tulsi gabbard ran in the democratic primaries gabbard received two delegates in the 2020 american samoa presidential caucuses in march68 american indian and alaska native voters preelection voter surveys by indian country today found native voters were overwhelmingly supporting democratic nominee joe biden69 in particular the navajo reservation which spans a large quadrant of eastern arizona and western new mexico delivered sometimes 97 of their votes per precinct to biden70 while overall support for biden was between 60 and 90 on the reservation71 biden also posted large turnout among havasupai hopi and tohono oodham peoples72 delivering a large win in new mexico and flipping arizona in montana while the state went for trump overall counties overlapping reservations of the blackfeet fort belknap crow and northern cheyenne went blue73 the same pattern holds in south dakota counties overlapping the lands of the standing rock sioux cheyenne river sioux oglala sioux rosebud sioux and crow creek tribes went for biden for example in oglala lakota county which overlaps with the pine ridge indian reservation biden scored 88 of the vote73 trumps lone spot of success appears to have been the lumbee tribe of north carolina where he won a strong majority in robeson county and flipped scotland county from blue to red74 trump had campaigned in lumberton and promised the lumbees federal recognition74 simultaneous elections the presidential election occurred simultaneously with elections to the senate and the house of representatives gubernatorial and legislative elections were also held in several states for the subsequent election the united states house will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the 2020 united states census and the states will conduct a redistricting of congressional and state legislative districts in most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting although some states have redistricting commissions often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a coattail effect that also helps other candidates of that party win elections75 therefore the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a significant advantage in drawing new congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections76 nominations democratic party nomination primaries in august 2018 the democratic national committee voted to disallow superdelegates from voting on the first ballot of the nominating process beginning with the 2020 election this required a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the partys nomination the last time this did not occur was the nomination of adlai stevenson ii at the 1952 democratic national convention77 meanwhile six states used rankedchoice voting in the primaries alaska hawaii kansas and wyoming for all voters and iowa and nevada for absentee voters78 after hillary clintons loss in the previous election the democratic party was seen largely as leaderless79 and was also seen as fractured between the centrist clinton wing and the more progressive sanders wing of the party echoing the rift brought up in the 2016 primary election8081 in 2018 several us house districts that democrats hoped to gain from the republican majority had contentious primary elections politicos elena schneider described these clashes as a democratic civil war82 during this period there was a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition healthcare and immigration among democrats in the senate8384 overall the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates85 breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the 2016 gop primaries with 17 major candidates86 entering the iowa caucuses on february 3 2020 the field had decreased to 11 major candidates pete buttigieg narrowly defeated bernie sanders in iowa then sanders edged out buttigieg in the february 11 new hampshire primary following michael bennet deval patrick and andrew yang dropping out sanders won the nevada caucuses on february 22 joe biden then won the south carolina primary causing buttigieg amy klobuchar and tom steyer to abandon their campaigns buttigieg and klobuchar then immediately endorsed biden after super tuesday march 3 michael bloomberg and elizabeth warren quit the race leaving three candidates left biden and sanders the main contenders and tulsi gabbard who remained in the race despite facing nighon insurmountable odds87 gabbard then dropped out and endorsed biden after the march 17 arizona florida and illinois races88 on april 8 2020 sanders dropped out reportedly after being convinced by former president barack obama leaving biden as the only major candidate remaining and the presumptive nominee8990 biden then gained endorsements from obama sanders and warren91 by june 5 2020 biden had officially gained enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the convention92 and proceeded to work with sanders to develop a joint policy task force93 vice presidential selection senator kamala harris was announced as former vice president joe bidens running mate on august 11 2020 when inaugurated harris will be the first woman first africanamerican and first asianamerican vice president of the united states as well as the second person with noneuropean ancestry after herbert hoovers vicepresident charles curtis she is the third female vice presidential running mate after geraldine ferraro in 1984 and sarah palin in 2008 she is the first person representing the western united states to appear on the democratic party presidential ticket94 nominee the following major candidates have either a served as vice president a member of the cabinet a us senator a us representative or a governor b been included in a minimum of five independent national polls or c received substantial media coverage republican party nomination primaries in election cycles with incumbent presidents running for reelection the race for the party nomination is usually proforma with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor151152 the 2020 election was not an exception with donald trump formally seeking a second term153154 the official republican apparatus both state and national coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge155156 on january 25 2019 the republican national committee unofficially endorsed trump157 several republican state committees scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses158 citing the fact that republicans canceled several state primaries when george h w bush and george w bush sought a second term in 1992 and 2004 respectively and democrats scrapped some of their primaries when bill clinton and barack obama were seeking reelection in 1996 and 2012 respectively159160 after cancelling their races some of those states such as hawaii and new york immediately pledged their delegates to trump161162 in contrast other states such as kansas and nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him163164 the trump campaign also urged republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 where a states delegates are divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage to switch to a winnertakesall where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates or winnertakesmost where the winning candidate only wins all of the states delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount otherwise they are divided proportionally for 2020152165 nevertheless reports arose beginning in august 2017 that members of the republican party were preparing a shadow campaign against the president particularly from the partys moderate or establishment wings thenarizona senator john mccain said republicans see weakness in this president166167 maine senator susan collins kentucky senator rand paul and former new jersey governor chris christie all expressed doubts in 2017 that trump would be the 2020 nominee with collins stating its too difficult to say168169 senator jeff flake claimed in 2017 that trump was inviting a primary challenger by the way he was governing170 however longtime political strategist roger stone predicted in may 2018 that trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and making america great again171 former massachusetts governor bill weld became trumps first major challenger in the republican primaries following an announcement on april 15 2019172 weld who was the libertarian partys nominee for vice president in 2016 was considered a long shot because of trumps popularity within his own party and welds positions on issues such as abortion gun control and samesex marriage that conflicted with conservative positions on those issues173 in addition businessman rocky de la fuente also entered the race but was not widely recognized as a major candidate174175 former illinois representative joe walsh launched a primary challenge on august 25 2019 saying im going to do whatever i can i dont want trump to win the country cannot afford to have him win if im not successful im not voting for him176 walsh ended his presidential bid on february 7 2020 after drawing around 1 support in the iowa caucuses walsh declared that nobody can beat trump in a republican primary because the republican party was now a cult of trump according to walsh trump supporters had become followers who think that trump can do no

presidential primary elections were severely disrupted by covid19related issues including long lines at polling places greatly increased requests for absentee ballots and technology issues241 the

but many voters complained that they never received the absentee ballots they had requested242 the march 2020 coronavirus aid relief and economic security act included money for states to increase mailin voting by may trump and his campaign strongly opposed mailin voting claiming that it would cause widespread voter fraud a belief which has been debunked by a number of media organizations243244

major campaign issue for both parties245246 on april 6 the supreme court and republicans in the state legislature of wisconsin rebuffed wisconsin governor tony everss request to move the states spring

received an experimental antibody treatment257258 trumps diagnosis came only two days after he had shared the stage with joe biden at the first presidential debate this led to the concern that biden may have contracted the virus from trump however biden tested negative259260 trump was discharged from the hospital on october 5261 trump being diagnosed with covid19 was widely seen as having a negative effect on his campaign and shifted the attention of the public back onto covid19 an issue which is generally seen as a liability for trump due to his response to the covid19 pandemic suffering from low approval ratings262263 being in quarantine also meant that trump was unable to attend rallies which were a major part of his campaign as a result of trump contracting covid19 biden continued campaigning but temporarily ceased running attack ads against him264265 trump resumed inperson rallies on october 12 one week after his discharge from the hospital261 trump continued to

to the house intelligence committee us intelligence officials warned congress that russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to support trumps reelection campaign trump was angered that congress had

governmentlinked chinese individuals have been accused of interfering in the election to support the candidacy of both biden and trump279 though whether it is actually doing so is disputed among the

that they hope will cause confusion sow chaos and undermine your confidence in american democracy a spokesman for iran denied the allegation282 in his announcement ratcliffe said that irans intent had been to intimidate voters incite social unrest and damage president trump raising questions as to how ordering democrats to vote for trump would be damaging to trump it was later reported that the

twitter posts interviews and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he was defeated trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him289290291 in july 2020 trump declined to answer whether he would accept the results telling fox news anchor chris wallace that i have to see no im not going to just say yes im not going to say no292293294 trump repeatedly claimed that the only way he could lose would be if the election was rigged and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election295 trump also attacked mailin voting throughout the campaign falsely claiming that the practice contains high rates of fraud296297298 at one point trump said well see what happensget rid of the ballots and youll have a very peaceful — there wont be a transfer frankly there will be a continuation299 trumps statements have been described as a threat to upend the constitutional order300 in september 2020 fbi director christopher a wray who was appointed by trump testified under oath that the fbi has not seen historically any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election whether its by mail or otherwise301 a number of congressional republicans insisted they were committed to an orderly and peaceful transition of power but declined to criticize trump for his comments302 on september 24 the senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming the senates commitment to a peaceful transfer of power303 trump has also stated he expected the supreme court to decide the election and that he wanted a conservative majority in case of an election dispute reiterating his commitment to quickly install a ninth justice following the death of ruth bader ginsburg304 election delay suggestion in april 2020 biden suggested that trump may try to delay the election saying that trump is gonna try to kick back the election somehow come up with some rationale why it cant be held305306 on july 30 trump tweeted that with universal mailin voting not absentee voting which is good 2020 will be the most inaccurate fraudulent election in history and asked if it should be delayed until people can safely cast ballots in person experts have indicated that for the election to be legally delayed such a decision must be undertaken by congress307308 several legal experts noted that the constitution sets the end of the presidential and vicepresidential terms as january 20 a hard deadline which cannot be altered by congress except by constitutional amendment309310 postal voting 311 chart of july 2020 opinion survey on likelihood of voting by mail in november election compared to 2016 postal voting in the united states has become increasingly common with 25 of voters mailing their ballots in 2016 and 2018 by june 2020 the covid19 pandemic was predicted to cause a large increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of congregating at polling places312 an august 2020 statebystate analysis concluded that 76 of americans are eligible to vote by mail in 2020 a record number the analysis predicted that 80 million ballots could be cast by mail in 2020—more than double the number in 2016313 the postal service sent a letter to multiple states in july 2020 warning that the service would not be able to meet the states deadlines for requesting and casting lastminute absentee ballots314 in addition to the anticipated high volume of mailed ballots the prediction was due in part to numerous measures taken by louis dejoy the newly installed united states postmaster general including banning overtime and extra trips to deliver mail315 which caused delays in delivering mail316 and dismantling and removing hundreds of highspeed mail sorting machines from postal centers317 on august 18 after the house of representatives had been recalled from its august break to vote on a bill reversing the changes dejoy announced that he would roll back all the changes until after the november election he said he would reinstate overtime hours roll back service reductions and halt the removal of mailsorting machines and collection boxes318 the house of representatives voted an emergency grant of 25 billion to the post office to facilitate the predicted flood of mail ballots319 however trump has repeatedly denounced mail voting even though he himself votes by mail in florida320 in august 2020 trump conceded that the post office would need additional funds to handle the additional mailin voting but said he would block any additional funding for the post office to prevent any increase in balloting by mail321 the trump campaign filed lawsuits seeking to block the use of official ballot dropboxes in pennsylvania in locations other than an election office and also sought to block election officials from counting mailin ballots if a voter forgets to put their mailin ballot in a secrecy sleeve within the ballot returnenvelope322 the trump campaign and the republican party both failed to produce any evidence of votebymail fraud after being ordered by a federal judge to do so322 on election day a judge ordered mail inspectors to search mail facilities in key battleground states for ballots323 the agency refused to comply with the order and nearly 7 of ballots in usps facilities on election day were not processed in time324 federal election commission issues the federal election commission which was created in 1974 to enforce campaign finance laws in federal elections has not functioned since july 2020 due to vacancies in membership in the absence of a quorum the commission cannot vote on complaints or give guidance through advisory opinions325 as of may 19 2020 there were 350 outstanding matters on the agencys enforcement docket and 227 items waiting for action326 as of september 1 2020 trump had not nominated anyone to fill the fec vacancies positions327 supreme court vacancy president donald trump with amy coney barrett and her family just prior to barrett being announced as the nominee september 26 2020 on september 18 2020 justice ruth bader ginsburg died senate majority leader mitch mcconnell immediately stated that the precedent he set regarding the merrick garland nomination was inoperative and that a replacement would be voted on as soon as possible setting the stage for a confirmation battle and an unexpected intrusion into the campaign328 the death of justice ginsburg resulted in large increases in momentum for both the democrats and republicans329330 the president331 vice president332 and several republican members of congress stated that a full supreme court bench was needed to decide the upcoming election333334 on september 26 the day after justice ginsburgs body lay in state at the capitol trump held a rose garden ceremony at the white house to announce and introduce his candidate amy coney barrett335 after four days of confirmation hearings the senate judiciary committee voted the nomination out of committee on october 22336 and on october 26 barrett was confirmed on a partyline vote of 52–48 with no democrats voting for her confirmation337 this was the closest supreme court confirmation ever to a presidential election and the first supreme court nomination since 1869 with no supporting votes from the minority party337 it was also one of the fastest timelines from nomination to confirmations in us history338339 according to the washington post a current issue for voters is the protection of the supreme court ruling of roe v wade on the legality of abortion340 preelection litigation by september 2020 several hundred legal cases relating to the 2020 election had been filed341 about 250 of these had to do with the mechanics of voting in relation to the covid19 pandemic341 the supreme court ruled on a number of these cases342 primarily issuing emergency stays instead of going through the normal process due to the urgency343 in october 2020 there was speculation that the election might be decided through a supreme court case as happened following the 2000 election344345 debates on october 11 2019 the commission on presidential debates cpd announced that three general election debates would be held in the fall of 2020 the first moderated by chris wallace took place on september 29 and was cohosted by case western reserve university and the cleveland clinic in cleveland ohio346 the debate was originally to be hosted at the university of notre dame in notre dame indiana but the university decided against holding the debate as a result of the covid19 pandemic346347 biden was generally held to have won the first debate348349350 with a significant minority of commentators stating that it was a draw351352 one exchange that was particularly noted was when trump did not directly denounce the white supremacist and neofascist group proud boys which explicitly engages in political violence instead responding that they should stand back and stand by353354355 on the next day trump told reporters that the group should stand down while also claiming that he was not aware of what the group was356357 the debate was described as chaotic and nearly incoherent because of trumps repeated interruptions causing the commission on presidential debates to consider adjustments to the format of the remaining debates358 the vice presidential debate was held on october 7 2020 at the university of utah in salt lake city359 the debate was widely held to be subdued with no clear victor360361 one incident that was particularly commented on was when a fly landed on vicepresident pences head and remained there unbeknownst to him for two minutes362363 the second debate was initially set to be held at the university of michigan in ann arbor michigan but the university withdrew in june 2020 over concerns regarding the covid19 pandemic364 the planned debate was rescheduled for october 15 at the adrienne arsht center for the performing arts in miami but due to trump contracting covid19 the commission on presidential debates announced on october 8 that the debate would be held virtually in which the candidates would appear from separate locations however trump refused to participate in a virtual debate and the commission subsequently announced that the debate had been cancelled365366 the third scheduled debate took place on october 22 at belmont university in nashville tennessee and was moderated by kristen welker367368 the changes to the debate rules resulted in it being generally considered more civil than the first debate369 welkers performance as moderator was praised with her being regarded as having done a good job preventing the candidates from interrupting each other370 biden was generally held to have won the debate though it was considered unlikely to alter the race to any considerable degree371372373 the free equal elections foundation held two debates with various third party and independent candidates one on october 8 2020 in denver colorado378 and another on october 24 2020 in cheyenne wyoming379 polling twoway the following graph depicts the standing of each candidate in

the election results for comparison endorsements campaign issues covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic was a major issue of the campaign with trumps responses being heavily criticized the president spread mixed messages on the value of wearing face masks as protection including criticizing biden and reporters for wearing them but has also encouraged their use at times380 during the campaign trump held many events across the country including in coronavirus hotspots where attendees did not wear masks and were not socially distancing at the same time he mocked those who wore face masks381382383 biden advocated for expansion of federal funding including funding under the defense production act for testing personal protective equipment and research384 trump has also invoked the defense production act to a lesser extent to control the distribution of masks and ventillators385 but his response plan relies significantly on a vaccine being released by the end of 2020384 at the second presidential debate trump claimed that biden had called him xenophobic for restricting entry from foreign nationals who had visited china but biden clarified that he had not been referring to this decision386 economy trump claimed credit for the consistent economic expansion of his presidencys first three years with the stock market at its longest growth period in history and unemployment at a fiftyyear low additionally he has touted the 2020 third quarter rebound in which gdp grew at an annualized rate of 331 as evidence of the success of his economic policies387 biden responded to trumps claims by repeating that the strong economy under trumps presidency was inherited from the obama administration and that trump has aggravated the economic impact of the pandemic including the need for 42 million americans to file for unemployment388 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 which lowered income tax for most americans as well as lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 were an important part of trumps economic policy biden and the democrats generally describe these cuts as unfairly benefiting the upper class biden plans to raise taxes on corporations and those making over 400000 per year while keeping the reduced taxes on lower income brackets and raise capital gains taxes to a maximum bracket of 396 in response trump said bidens plans will destroy retirement accounts and the stock market389 environment trump and bidens views on environmental policy differ significantly trump has stated at times that climate change is a hoax although he has also called it a serious subject390 trump has condemned the paris agreement on greenhouse gas reduction and began the withdrawal process biden plans to rejoin it and announced a 2 trillion climate action plan however biden has not fully accepted the green new deal biden does not plan to ban fracking but rather to outlaw new fracking on federal land however in a debate trump claimed that biden wanted to ban it altogether trumps other environmental policies have included the removal of methane emission standards and an expansion of mining391 health care health care was a divisive issue in both the democratic primary campaign and the general campaign while biden as well as other candidates promised protection of the affordable care act progressives within the democratic party advocated to replace the private insurance industry with medicare for all bidens plan involves adding a public option to the american healthcare system392 and the restoration of the individual mandate to buy health care which was removed from the affordable care act by the 2017 tax cut bill393 as well as restoring funding for planned parenthood trump announced plans to repeal the affordable care act calling it too expensive but has not said what would replace it394 at the time of the election the trump administration and republican officials from 18 states had a lawsuit before the supreme court asking the court to repeal the affordable care act395 racial unrest as a result of the killing of george floyd and other incidents of police brutality against african americans combined with the effects of the covid19 pandemic a series of protests and a wider period of racial unrest erupted in mid2020396 many peaceful protests took place but riots and looting have also occurred trump and the republicans have suggested sending in the military to counter the protests which was criticized especially by democrats as heavyhanded and potentially illegal397 particularly controversial was a photoop trump took in front of st johns church in washington dc before which military police had forcefully cleared peaceful protestors from the area393 biden condemned trump for his actions against protestors he described george floyds words i cant breathe as a wakeup call for our nation he also promised he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president and establish a uniform use of force standard as well as other police reform measures398 state predictions most election predictors use tossup no advantage no advantage tilt advantage that is not quite as strong as lean advantage that is

totaling 306 electoral votes trump carried 25 states plus one congressional district in maine totaling 232 electoral votes that result is the exact opposite of trumps 306to232 win in 2016413 almost all counties previously considered reliable indicators of eventual success in presidential elections voted for trump instead of biden meaning that they did not continue their streaks as bellwether counties this was attributed to increasing political polarization throughout the country414 more than 157 million votes were cast in the election415 more than 100 million of them were cast before election day by early voting or mail ballot due to the ongoing pandemic416 trump became the first us president since 1992 and the eleventh incumbent in the countrys history to fail to win reelection to a second term and biden won the largest share of the popular vote against an incumbent since 1932678 the election saw the highest voter turnout as a percentage of eligible voters since 1900417 each ticket received more than 73 million votes surpassing barack obamas record of 695 million votes from 20089 the bidenharris ticket received more than 80 million votes the most votes ever in a us presidential election1011 election night election night november 3 ended without a clear winner as many state results were too close to call and millions of votes remained uncounted including in the battleground states of wisconsin michigan pennsylvania north carolina georgia arizona and nevada418 results were delayed in these states due to local rules on counting mailin ballots in a victory declared after midnight trump won the swing state of florida by three percentage points an increase from his 12 percentage point margin in 2016 having seen significant gains in support among the latino community in miamidade county419 shortly after 1230 am est biden made a short speech in which he urged his supporters to be patient while the votes are counted and said he believed he was on track to win this election420421 shortly before 230 am est trump made a speech to a roomful of supporters falsely asserting that he had won the election and calling for a stop to all vote counting saying that continued counting was a fraud on the american people and that we will be going to the us supreme court422423424 the biden campaign denounced these attempts claiming that the trump campaign was engaging in a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of american citizens425 subsequent events in pennsylvania where the counting of mailin ballots began on election night trump declared victory on november 4 with a lead of 675000 votes despite more than a million ballots remaining uncounted trump also declared victory in north carolina and georgia despite many ballots being uncounted426 at 1120 pm est on election night fox news projected biden would win arizona with the associated press making the same call at 250 am est on november 4427428 however several other media outlets concluded the state was too close to call429430 by the evening of november 4 the associated press reported that biden had secured 264 electoral votes by winning michigan and wisconsin with pennsylvania north carolina georgia and nevada remaining uncalled431 biden had a 1 lead in nevada432 and maintained a 23 lead in arizona by november 5433 needing only to win nevada and arizona or win pennsylvania to obtain the necessary 270 electoral votes431 some trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on election night only to see biden take the lead in subsequent days election experts attributed this to several factors including a red mirage of early results being counted in relatively thinlypopulated rural areas that favored trump which are quicker to count followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored biden which take longer to count in some states like pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin republicancontrolled legislatures prohibited mailin ballots from being counted before election day and once those ballots were counted they generally favored biden at least in part because trump had for months raised concerns about mailin ballots causing those ballots to favor biden even more by contrast in states such as florida which allowed counting of mailin ballots for weeks prior to election day an early blue shift giving the appearance of a biden lead was later overcome by inperson voting that favored trump resulting in the state being called for the president on election night434435436 on november 5 a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by the trump campaign to stop votecounting in pennsylvania the trump campaign had alleged that its observers were not given access to observe the vote but its lawyers admitted during the hearing that its observers were already present in the votecounting room437 also that day a state judge dismissed another lawsuit by the trump campaign that alleged that in georgia latearriving ballots were counted the judge ruled no evidence had been produced that the ballots were late438 meanwhile a state judge in michigan dismissed the trump campaigns lawsuit requesting a pause in votecounting to allow access to observers as the judge noted that votecounting had already finished in michigan439 that judge also noted the official complaint did not state why when where or by whom an election observer was allegedly blocked from observing ballotcounting in michigan440 on november 6 biden assumed leads in pennsylvania and georgia as the states continued to count ballots and absentee votes in those states heavily favored biden441 due to the slim margin between biden and trump in the state georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger announced on november 6 that a recount would be held in georgia at that point georgia had not seen any widespread irregularities in this election according to the voting system manager of the state gabriel sterling442 also on november 6 us supreme court justice samuel alito issued an order requiring officials in pennsylvania to segregate latearriving ballots amid a dispute as to whether the states supreme court validly ordered a 3day extension of the deadline for mailin ballots to arrive443 several republican attorneys general filed amicus briefs before the us supreme court in subsequent days agreeing with the pennsylvania gops view that only the state legislature could change the voting deadline444 by november 7 several prominent republicans had publicly denounced trumps claims of electoral fraud saying they were unsubstantiated baseless or without evidence damaging to the election process undermining democracy and dangerous to political stability while others supported his demand of transparency445 according to cnn people close to donald trump such as his soninlaw and senior adviser jared kushner and his wife melania trump urged him to accept his defeat while donald trump privately acknowledged the outcome of the presidential election he nonetheless encouraged his legal team to continue pursuing legal challenges446 election calls hexagonal cartogram

group of european lawmakers acting as shortterm observers led by german parliamentarian michael georg link reporting from maryland virginia california nevada michigan missouri wisconsin and the district of columbia457459 due to the covid19 pandemic it was scaled down to a limited election observation mission from the originally planned 100 longterm observers and 400 shortterm observers457 an interim report published by the osce shortly before the election noted that many odihr interlocutors expressed grave concerns about the risk of legitimacy of the elections being questioned due to the incumbent presidents repeated allegations of a fraudulent election process and postal vote in particular457460 on the day after the election the task force published preliminary findings458 with part of the summary stating the 3 november general elections were competitive and well managed despite legal uncertainties and logistical challenges in a highly polarized political environment acrimonious campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidencedeficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters voter registration and identification rules in some states are unduly restrictive for certain groups of citizens the media although sharply polarized provided comprehensive coverage of the campaign and made efforts to provide accurate information on the organization of elections461 link stated that on the election day itself we couldnt see any violations at the polling places visited by the observers458 the task force also found nothing untoward while observing the handling of mailin ballots at post offices with gacek being quoted as saying that we feel that allegations of systemic wrongdoing in these elections have no solid ground and that the system has held

preliminary election results by county viewership polling accuracy although polls generally predicted the biden victory the national polls were moderately imprecise by about 3–4 points and some state polling was even further from the actual result this also applied in several senate races where the democrats were also underperformed by around 5 points relative to the polls512 most pollsters underestimated support for trump in several states including florida iowa michigan texas and wisconsin a notable exception was ann selzer who accurately predicted republican victories in iowa for the presidential and senate races the discrepancy between poll predictions and the actual result persisted from the 2016 election despite pollsters attempts to fix problems with polling in 2016 in which they underestimated the republican vote in several states the imprecise polls led to changes in campaigning and fundraising decisions for both democrats and republicans513 according to the new york times polling misses have been attributed to among other issues reduced average response to polling the relative difficulty to poll certain types of voters and pandemicrelated problems such as a theory which suggests democrats were less willing to vote in person on election day than republicans for fear of contracting covid19513 new statesman data journalist ben walker pointed to hispanics as a historically difficult group to poll accurately leading to pollsters underestimating the level of trump support within the demographic group514 controversies election protests protests against trumps challenges to the election results took place in minneapolis portland new york and other cities police in minneapolis arrested more than 600 demonstrators for blocking traffic on an interstate highway in portland the national guard was called out after some protesters smashed windows and threw objects at police515 at the same time groups of trump supporters gathered outside of election centers in phoenix detroit and philadelphia shouting objections to counts that showed biden leading or gaining ground515 in arizona where bidens lead was shrinking as more results were reported the protrump protesters mostly demanded that all remaining votes be counted while in michigan and pennsylvania where trumps lead shrank and disappeared altogether as more results were reported they called for the count to be stopped516 false claims of fraud trump and a variety of his surrogates and supporters made a series of false claims that the election was fraudulent claims that substantial fraud was committed have been repeatedly debunked517518 on november 9 and 10 the new york times called the offices of top election officials in every state all of the 45 state officials who responded stated that there was no evidence of fraud some described the election as remarkably successful considering the coronavirus pandemic the record turnout and the unprecedented number of mailed ballots20 on november 12 the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency issued a statement calling the 2020 election the most secure in american history and noting there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes changed votes or was in any way compromised22 519520 during the week following the election trump repeatedly claimed that he had won the election as ballots were still being counted two days after election day trump asserted without evidence that there was tremendous corruption and fraud going on adding if you count the legal votes i easily win if you count the illegal votes they can try to steal the election from us521 trump has claimed repeatedly that the mailin ballots being heavily probiden is suspicious522 this is a common phenomenon known as the blue shift since more democrats than republicans tend to vote by mail and mail ballots are counted after election day in many states leading up to the 2020 election the effect was predicted to be even greater than usual as trumps attacks on mail voting might have deterred republicans from casting mail ballots523 many claims of purported voter fraud were discovered to be false or misleading a breitbart news story claimed that biden had won an extra 3000 votes in fulton county georgia after a reporting error524 in fact the number of votes affected was 342 with no breakdown of which candidates they were for525 a viral video of a pennsylvania poll worker filling out a ballot was found to be a case of a damaged ballot being replicated to ensure proper counting while a video claimed to show a man taking ballots illegally to a detroit counting center was found to be actually depicting a photographer transporting his equipment526527 another video of a poll watcher being turned away in philadelphia was found to be real but the poll watcher had subsequently been allowed inside after a misunderstanding had been resolved528 a tweet that went viral claimed that 14000 votes in wayne county michigan — which encompasses detroit — were cast by dead people but the list of names included was found to be incorrect529 the trump campaign and tucker carlson also claimed a james blalock had voted in georgia despite having died in 2006 though his 94yearold widow had registered and voted as mrs james e blalock530 in erie pennsylvania a postal worker who claimed that the postmaster had instructed postal workers to backdate ballots mailed after election day later admitted he had fabricated the claim prior to his recantation republican senator lindsey graham cited the claim in a letter to the justice department calling for an investigation and the worker was praised as a patriot on a gofundme page created in his name that raised 136000531 days after biden had been declared the winner white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany asserted without evidence that the democratic party was welcoming fraud and illegal voting532 republican former speaker of the house newt gingrich stated on fox news i think that it is a corrupt stolen election533 appearing at a press conference outside a philadelphia landscaping business as biden was being declared the winner trumps personal attorney rudy giuliani asserted without evidence that hundreds of thousands of ballots were questionable534 responding to giuliani a spokesperson for pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro said many of the claims against the commonwealth have already been dismissed and repeating these false attacks is reckless no active lawsuit even alleges and no evidence presented so far has shown widespread problems20 one week after the election republican philadelphia city commissioner al schmidt said he had not seen any evidence of widespread fraud stating i have seen the most fantastical things on social media making completely ridiculous allegations that have no basis in fact at all and see them spread he added that his office had examined a list of dead people who purportedly voted in philadelphia but not a single one of them voted in philadelphia after they died trump derided schmidt tweeting he refuses to look at a mountain of corruption dishonesty we win535 attorneys who brought accusations of voting fraud or irregularities before judges were unable to produce actual evidence to support the allegations in one instance a trump attorney sought to have ballot counting halted in detroit on the basis of a claim by a republican poll watcher that she had been told by an unidentified person that ballots were being backdated michigan court of appeals judge cynthia stephens dismissed the argument as inadmissible hearsay within hearsay536537 some senior attorneys at law firms working on trumps behalf notably jones day expressed concerns that they were helping to undermine the integrity of american elections by advancing arguments lacking evidence538 in a press conference on november 19 held by giuliani and several other members of trumps legal team it was claimed without evidence that the reason for trumps loss was that the canadian firm dominion voting systems which had supplied voting machines for 27 states was a communist organisation controlled by billionaire george soros former venezuelan president hugo chávez who died in 2013 and the chinese communist party and that the machines had stolen hundreds of thousands of votes in the middle of the night these claims were debunked by the associated press539540 lawsuits after the election the trump campaign filed a number of lawsuits in multiple states including georgia michigan nevada and pennsylvania541 lawyers and other observers have noted the suits are unlikely to have an effect on the outcome loyola law school professor justin levitt said theres literally nothing that ive seen yet with the meaningful potential to affect the final result542 some law firms have moved to drop their representation in lawsuits challenging results of the election543 in nevada—a state trump lost by 24 percentage points—the presidents campaign team filed a lawsuit asking a judge to either declare trump the winner or to reject the states election results in pennsylvania—which biden won by more than 82000 votes—trump lawyer rudy giuliani was in court asking a judge to overturn the states results at bottom youre asking this court to invalidate some 68 million votes thereby disenfranchising every single voter in the commonwealth the judge said544 trumps refusal to concede early in the morning on november 4 with vote counts still going on in many states trump claimed that he had won545 for weeks after the networks had called the election for biden trump refused to acknowledge that biden had won biden described trumps refusal as an embarrassment546 the general services administration gsa was blocking preparations for a transfer of power from proceeding547 the white house ordered government agencies not to cooperate with the biden transition team in any way548 starting in 1896 when william jennings bryan began the tradition of formal concession by sending a congratulatory telegram to presidentelect william mckinley every losing major party presidential candidate has formally conceded549 trump acknowledged bidens victory in a tweet on november 15 although he refused to concede and blamed his loss on fraud he won because the election was rigged trump said before tweeting i concede nothing we have a long way to go550551 gsa delays certifying biden as presidentelect although all major media outlets called the election for biden on november 7 the head of the general services administration gsa trump appointee emily w murphy refused for two weeks to certify biden as the presidentelect without formal gsa certification or ascertainment of the winner of the election the official transition process was delayed33 on november 23 murphy acknowledged biden as the winner and said the trump administration would begin the formal transition process trump said he had instructed his administration to do what needs to be done but did not concede and indicated he intended to continue his fight to overturn the election results34 suggestion to have state legislatures choose electoral college voters prior to and following the election trump and others within the republican party have considered asking republican state legislatures to select their states electors as a way to secure a trump reelection in the event of a biden victory552553554 in pennsylvania the presidents personal lawyer rudy giuliani asked a federal judge to consider ordering the state legislature to select the electors555 legal experts including new york university law professor richard pildes have said that such a strategy would run into numerous legal and political problems noting that in various battleground states democratic party members elected to statewide offices would thwart such efforts552 and ultimately congress likely would not accept the votes of legislatively appointed electors over those appointed based on the election results556 lawrence lessig noted that while the constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine how electors are selected including the power to directly appoint them article ii section 1 clause 4 gives congress the power to determine when electors must be appointed which they have designated to be election day meaning that legislatures cannot change how electors are appointed for an election after this date557 in modern times most states have used a popular vote within their state as the determining factor in who gets all of the states electors552 and changing election rules after an election has been conducted could also violate the constitutions due process clause558 attempts to delay or deny election results on november 18 it was reported that trump had decided to focus his efforts on a bid to delay final vote counts for long enough that biden is unable to claim a clear victory trump maintained that he would win the election tweeting important news conference today by lawyers on a very clear and viable path to victory pieces are very nicely falling into place rnc at 1200 pm 559 the two republican members of wayne county michigans canvassing board voted against certifying its election results before reversing course with trump praising the action writing on twitter wow michigan just refused to certify the election results having courage is a beautiful thing the usa stands proud after the move drew severe condemnation and the two republican canvassers were widely publicly denounced with one video of a local entrepreneur harshly accusing the gop canvassers of racism going viral online the board reversed course and certified the results for biden560 many election law experts noted that one of the republicans on the board of county canvassers suggested certifying the vote for areas of wayne county outside the city of detroit as the residents of detroit are mostly black while the areas of wayne county outside detroit are mostly white experts raised questions of racebased motives for refusing the certification of the vote561 after signing off on certification of the wayne county election result the two republican members of the board were contacted by the trump campaign the following day they both signed affidavits stating they wanted to rescind their vote562 furthermore the two republican members on the state board of canvassers faced pressure from republicans not to certify the statewide vote one example of this was shane trejo who runs a farright website called big league politics sending out an email blast urging fellow patriots to tell the two republican state canvassers that they would never vote republican again unless they voted against certification563 the attempts to prevent the michigan electoral votes for being cast for biden went even further as trump flew in the two top republicans in the michigan legislature to the white house on november 20 amid the standoff564565 on november 25 one day after pennsylvania certified its election results a republican state senator requested a hearing of the state senate majority policy committee to discuss election issues the event described as an informational meeting was held at a hotel in gettysburg and featured rudy giuliani asserting that the election had been subject to massive fraud trump also spoke to the group by speakerphone repeating his insistence that he had actually won in pennsylvania and other swing states and saying we have to turn the election over566 similar partisan hearings took place in arizona and michigan on november 30 and december 1567 recounts on november 11 georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger ordered a statewide hand recount of the vote in addition to the normal audit process at the time biden held a lead of 14112 votes or 03 in the state568 the audit was concluded on november 19 and affirmed bidens lead by 12670 votes citing a number of human errors including memory cards that did not upload properly to the state servers but no fraud in the original tally georgia law allows for a recount if there is a margin of 05 the current margin is 02569 after the state certified the results republican governor brian kemp called for another hand audit demanding to compare signatures on absentee ballot requests to actual ballots trump condemned both kemp and raffensperger tweeting that signature comparisons would give victories to not only him but also senators david perdue and kelly loeffler570 loeffler came in second place in the november 3 first round with 259 of the vote on november 21 the trump campaign requested a machine recount which will cost taxpayers 200000 but will not address concerns about absentee ballot signatures571 on november 18 the trump campaign wired 3 million to pay for partial recounts in milwaukee county and dane county wisconsin where milwaukee and madison the two largest cities in the state and democratic strongholds are located572 during the recount milwaukee county election commissioner tim posnanski stated that several republican observers were breaking rules by posing as independents the recount started november 20 and was required to be completed by december 1573 completed by november 29 the recounts increased bidens lead by 87 votes574 see also notes

announced a slate of staff hires aimed at flipping the historically conservative lone star state last won by a democratic presidential candidate in 1976 by jimmy carter the biden campaign insists its push for the states 38 electoral college votes is real get breaking news delivered to your inbox we are quite serious about putting texas in play jenn ridder the campaigns national states director told cbs news increasingly we are seeing polls that show that there is real opportunity there for us the cbs news battleground tracker in midjuly showed biden just one point behind president trump six texas democratic operatives have already been hired led by state director rebecca acuña who was raised in laredo and has worked in various roles in state and congressional politics president trumps handling of the pandemic has brought about the focus on the state according to a biden campaign official and that message was broadcast briefly last month via a sixfigure ad buy on texas television joe biden is also going to win texas in the general election for three reasons texas congressman filemon vela an early biden endorser told cbs news first donald trump and governor abbott have made tactical decisions in their covid response that is now killing texans en masse second biden will defeat trump in the texas suburbs finally from a historical perspective biden will outperform past democratic candidates in the rural counties along with suburban voters the campaign hopes to capitalize on series of competitive congressional races across the state and focus on turning out latino and africanamerican voters especially in the dallas houston and san antonio markets a campaign official told cbs news theres already some evidence of democratic enthusiasm in the state — a new turnout record was set by the 955000 texas democrats who voted in a recent senate primary election which the texas observer noted is twice the number that voted in the partys 2018 gubernatorial primary the biden campaign official also said what separates its approach to texas from previous democratic presidential campaigns is the organizing resources will be directed at turning out texas voters and not using instate organizers to contact voters in other battleground states the operation will be led by the other texas campaign leadership including jennifer longoria tariq thowfeek mike collier jane hamilton and shekira dennis new digital ads in english and spanish are also set to launch on monday to commemorate the oneyear anniversary of the shooting at the el paso walmart which killed 23 people

buy more tv advertising cbs news was told the campaign has been on the air in other states like arizona florida michigan north carolina pennsylvania wisconsin and nevada bidens team in texas will focus on hiring more field organizers throughout august the campaign official said in addition to the existing 19 organizers involved in coordinating with the texas democratic party for now the covid19 surge precludes inperson efforts and organizing remains virtual the campaign claims its seeing higher contact rates since more people are at home answering phone calls and texts while many texas republican leaders like senator ted cruz have warned supporters of growing enthusiasm for biden and downballot democratic candidates and the potentially adverse effects this would have on the future of the republican party and the conservative cause several trump campaign officials and gop operatives privately doubt the ability of the biden team to organize effectively enough by november they cite the biden campaigns recent sixfigure tv ad buy in the state as an example of as some might say in texas all hat and no cattle one trump campaign official described the purchase as less effective than a welldistributed press release given that the state has 20 media markets before the coronavirus halted inperson campaigning biden made several trips to texas during the democratic

women poll the result includes a more than 21 biden lead in the philadelphia suburbs overwhelming support in philadelphia and its suburbs lift former vice president joe biden to a clear lead in crucial pennsylvania with backing from collegeeducated white people and women notably white moderate and suburban women central to his advantage in a new abc newswashington post poll president donald trump for his part is suffering attrition among his 2016 supporters 8 of them now back biden instead while a small slice of the electorate it’s a potentially important factor in a state trump won by 44292 votes out of nearly 62 million cast four years ago likely voters support biden over trump by 54 to 45 almost exactly matching a national abcpost poll released sunday the result includes more than a 2 to 1 biden lead in the populous philadelphia suburbs home to nearly a quarter of likely voters and close results in northeastern and western pennsylvania leaving only the conservative center of the state clearly to trump see pdf for full results charts and tables with the first presidential debate tuesday night in cleveland the poll marks trump’s challenges in pennsylvania also reflected in the crucial midwest and indeed nationally sixty percent of registered voters in pennsylvania say the economy is hurting 62 are worried about catching the coronavirus and 54 support protests against police treatment of black people each aids biden trump’s chief task though is to overcome majority disapproval of his firstterm performance as is the case nationally his overall job approval rating is well under water in pennsylvania 43 to 55 approvedisapprove and it’s 42 to 57 for his handling of the pandemic a shift from 2016 underscores trump’s difficulty likely voters in this survey who report having voted four years ago say they backed trump over hillary clinton by 50 to 47 close to the actual result 48 to 47 today clinton voters favor biden by 98 to 1 but trump slips his 2016 supporters divide by 92 to 8 like all preelection polls this survey measures current preferences among estimated likely voters either or both can change it’s an open question for instance whether sunday’s new york times report on trump’s tax returns a day after interviews were completed has any impact trump does have ammunition in this poll produced for abc by langer research associates a 20point advantage in strong enthusiasm among his supporters 53 approval for handling the economy solid backing in his base and a clear lead among voters who plan to cast their ballot in person on election day that said biden’s lackluster enthusiasm may be counterbalanced by antipathy toward trump pennsylvania registered voters who strongly disapprove of the president’s job performance outnumber strong approvers by 17 percentage points 49 to 32 it’s similar nationally biden further may gain some energy from the pending replacement of justice ruth bader ginsburg on the us supreme court contrary to trump and his party’s current course 53 of registered voters in the state say the seat should be filled by the election winner and the next senate not by trump and the current senate moreover 61 of biden’s supporters say this issue makes it more important to them that biden wins fewer trump supporters 41 say the same about their candidate national results again are roughly similar voting one difference in pennsylvania is the large share of registered voters planning to cast ballots in person on election day 65 and 67 among likely voters compared with 45 of registered voters nationally it’s also been lower though in a wide range in other abcpost polls this month 59 in minnesota and 51 in wisconsin dropping to 38 in florida and 33 in arizona it can matter intended election day voters favor trump over biden by 60 to 39 those who plan to vote early by contrast favor biden by a remarkable 87 to 13 ensuring that those early and absentee votes are cast and counted is a central concern for the biden campaign issues unlike some elections in which a single issue dominates a mix of concerns is at play twentyfive percent of pennsylvania registered voters cite the economy as the top issue for 18 it’s the pandemic twelve to 14 pick either crime and safety equal treatment of racial groups or health care nine percent say it’s the next appointment to the high court trump and biden run approximately evenly in trust to handle two of these the economy 49 to 48 trumpbiden and crime and safety 50 to 47 bidentrump it’s biden 9 points on the next supreme court appointment 14 points on handling the pandemic 17 points on health care and 20 points in trust to handle equal treatment of racial groups even with that roughly even headtohead match on the economy likely voters who cite the economy as the most important issue in their vote back trump by 84 to 16 this and crime and safety are his best issues those who focus on the pandemic back biden 93 to 5 and he leads by a wide margin among those who cite health care and equal treatment as well as mentioned views on the economy the pandemic and protests against police misconduct all are important attitudes on each of these independently predict candidate choice in a statistical model controlling for partisanship ideology raceethnicity and other demographic variables that’s also reflected in direct votepreference results biden leads by 69 points among those who rate the economy negatively 73 points among those who support the protests and 51 points among those worried about catching the coronavirus majority groups in each case trump leads by wide margins among their opposites groups demographically women collegeeducated and moderate voters are key elements of biden’s support the democrat leads among women by 61 to 38 while men divide far more closely 53 to 46 trumpbiden a wide 30point gender gap among white people only men favor trump by a wide 60 to 39 while white women support biden by 56 to 43 the gap is narrower in the suburbs but notable nonetheless given that suburban residents account for six in 10 likely voters in the state the race is essentially a dead heat among suburban men 51 to 49 trumpbiden while it’s 59 to 41 bidentrump among suburban woman that produces an overall result in the suburbs of 54 to 45 exactly matching the race statewide regionally biden’s ahead by 69 to 31 in the philadelphia suburbs compared with clinton’s 55 to 42 there four years ago biden’s also improved on clinton’s result in western pennsylvania while the race in the state’s other regions are more similar to what it was four years ago trump cruises among conservatives with 87 support as does biden among liberals 92 moderates divide by a wide margin in biden’s favor 63 to 35 with another broad gender gap biden’s 7 points among moderate men balloons to 47 among moderate women a 40point gap other divisions also are broad among likely voters who haven’t gone beyond high school it’s trump 18 points among those with college degrees biden 29 and it’s about even 51 to 48 trumpbiden among white people while biden leads by a wide margin among racial and ethnic minorities the shift from 2016 among collegeeducated white people is especially telling in the abc news exit poll in pennsylvania four years ago this group divided exactly evenly 48 to 48 among likely voters today collegeeducated white people support biden by 61 to 38 that includes a 63 to 35 race among collegeeducated white women but here the big shift is among collegeeducated white men they backed trump by 56 to 39 in 2016

of them again likely to vote absentee georgia law has allowed any registered voter to request an absentee ballot without having to provide an excuse since 2005 “as we take care of each other through a pandemic of historic proportions we need to make sure that every vote counts” said nse ufot the executive director of the new georgia project “this is a commonsense solution to a problem we’ve been seeing for some time it’s a good day for georgia and a good day for democracy” every election absentee ballots are discarded in georgia because they arrive too late even if ballots were mailed well in advance of election day the us postal service didn’t always deliver them in time a problem exacerbated by potential mail slowdowns this year in this year’s primary election officials disqualified at least 8495 absentee ballots because they were received late according to state election data that amounts to less than 1 of all absentee ballots cast the number of ballots received after election day is expected to grow in november attorneys for the new georgia project argued in court that as many as 60000 ballots could arrive late in the general election the democratic party of georgia called the ruling “a huge victory for georgia voters” “all georgians deserve to have their voice heard and in the midst of a global pandemic it is the responsibility of our democracy to make voting by mail and early voting options as accessible as possible” democratic party of georgia chairwoman nikema williams said attorneys for georgia had warned that delaying the absentee deadline could result in chaos as election results hang in the balance election officials will have to scramble to count ballots quickly and verify that absentee ballots were in fact postmarked by nov 3 state law requires election results to be certified 17 days after the election by nov 20 “the court notes it is reluctant to interfere with georgia’s statutory election machinery however where the risk of disenfranchisement is great as is the case here narrowly tailored injunctive relief is appropriate” ross wrote ross wrote that georgia election officials have already shown they’re capable of processing absentee ballots received after election day state law requires election officials to count absentee ballots from overseas and military voters if they’re received within three days of an election georgia joins 18 other states that accept absentee ballots after election day if they’re postmarked beforehand according to the national conference of state legislatures ross denied other changes sought by the lawsuit including free ballot postage quick notification of absentee application deficiencies automatic mailing of absentee ballots to all voters and ballot collection by thirdparty organizations election officials are urging georgians to vote early to avoid lines and other problems the us postal service has said that mail delivery delays could hold up absentee ballots voters should mail their completed ballots at least a week in advance of election day by oct 27 according to a usps letter to secretary of state brad raffensperger georgia voters can also cast absentee ballots without having to rely on the postal service many counties have set up drop boxes where voters can deposit their ballots until polls close on election day voters can request absentee ballots through a website created by raffensperger’s office at ballotrequestsosgagov then absentee ballots will begin to be mailed in late september how to vote absentee in georgia any registered voter in georgia can request an absentee ballot without having to provide an explanation voters can order an absentee ballot online at ballotrequestsosgagov they can also fill out and mail a paper absentee ballot request form to county election offices election officials will begin mailing absentee ballots to voters around sept 18 state law prevents absentee ballots from being mailed before 49 days prior to election day then voters can mail their absentee ballots or return them in drop boxes set up in many counties

trump and became known as never trump republicans many were blacklisted for jobs in the trump administration for having signed the letters by law military service members must remain apolitical while in uniform but most senior officers stay out of the political arena even after they hang up their uniforms although the number of retired senior officers wading into politics has steadily increased over the past two decades thursdays letter was notable for the sheer number of top brass from every branch of the military who chose to endorse biden we are republicans democrats and independents we love our country unfortunately we also fear for it they wrote the retired officers and officials said the country needs a principled honest leader who shows empathy for fellow citizens values alliances makes informed decisions and takes personal responsibility while some of us may have different opinions on particular policy matters we trust joe bidens positions are rooted in sound judgment thorough understanding and fundamental values they wrote the current president has demonstrated he is not equal to the enormous responsibilities of his office he cannot rise to meet challenges large or small thanks to his disdainful attitude and his failures our allies no longer trust or respect us and our enemies no longer fear us the letter says climate change continues unabated as does north koreas nuclear program the president has ceded influence to a russian adversary who puts bounties on the heads of american military personnel and his trade war against china has only harmed americas farmers and manufacturers it says several retired african american military leaders signed the letter including retired lt gen walt gaskin who commanded marines in western iraq

des moines register and tribune co fresh off a fourway primary race that drew millions in outside spending democrat theresa greenfield leads republican sen joni ernst by 3 percentage points in iowa’s hotly contested us senate race a new des moines registermediacom iowa poll shows according to the poll 46 of likely voters say they would back greenfield if the election were held today and 43 say they would back ernst “this is definitely a competitive race” said j ann selzer president of selzer co which conducted the poll she said the poll contains other “warning signs” for ernst and noted that this is the first iowa poll conducted since ernst first ran in 2014 in which she has trailed her general election opponent “symbolically thats certainly meaningful even if theresa greenfields lead is not commanding” selzer said the poll which was conducted june 710 has a margin of error of plus or minus 38 percentage points for questions asked of the 674 likely voters in the 2020 general election and plus or minus 35 percentage points for those asked of 801 iowans republicans democrats already spending millions the results come at the start of a general election cycle likely to be shaped by social and economic turmoil wrought by a global pandemic nationwide protests around racial justice and a volatile incumbent president seeking reelection both parties have already invested heavily in iowa underscoring its political importance as republicans seek to defend their narrow 53 to 47seat majority in the us senate democrats have charted a path to the majority that includes taking on vulnerable incumbents in arizona colorado maine and north carolina as democrats work to defend their own endangered incumbent in alabama they’re hoping to expand their opportunities by investing heavily in iowa where they see ernst as beatable the senator’s job approval rating among all iowans began to drop earlier this year according to register polling falling to 47 in march from 57 a year before this poll shows that rating has changed little now at 49 another 39 say they disapprove of the job she is doing and 13 are unsure ronda hennings a 61yearold bonaparte resident and poll respondent said she didn’t vote for ernst but had high hopes for her when she took office “i wanted her to get out there and really talk about the people that put her in office” hennings said “and all i can see from her shes a yes player she just goes along with whatever the party says and she puts her votes in and she says ‘yes’” hennings who is disabled and benefits from social security payments said she appreciates that greenfield talks about the importance of that program in her advertising greenfield’s first husband died in a workplace accident leaving her a single mother who relied on social security benefits to get by “i know that she’s gone through the system and knows how it works” hennings said “and a lot of people don’t” greenfield is viewed favorably by 41 of iowans and unfavorably by 20 although she is substantially better known today than she was in march a large group remains — 39 — who say they don’t know enough about greenfield to form an opinion fortyfive percent of iowans have a favorable view of ernst and 40 say they have an unfavorable view those numbers have dipped during the past year in february 2019 56 said they had a favorable view of ernst and 29 had an unfavorable view ernst appeals to the heart of iowas gop base ernst does well with many of the demographic groups that also backed republican president donald trump in the 2016 election she earns 67 of the evangelical vote compared with 22 for greenfield fiftysix percent of likely voters living in rural parts of the state back her over greenfield who earns 32 and men are more likely to favor ernst fiftythree percent of men support her compared with 37 for greenfield and white men without a college degree back her 59 to 30 “thats the heart of the republican base in iowa” selzer said ernst has occasionally distanced herself from some of trump’s more controversial comments including his call to ban transgender americans from serving in the military and she called it racist when the president issued tweets calling on four democratic congresswomen of color to “go back” to the countries they came from still ernst has defended the president on numerous occasions including during his impeachment hearings and she frequently attends events with him and touts his praise of her on thursday the president tweeted his support for ernst saying “few people have ever fought as strongly for iowa” as she has trump carried the state by 9 percentage points over democrat hillary clinton in 2016 but democrats made gains in 2018 by flipping two congressional seats darwin vice a 59year old libertyville resident and poll respondent said he plans to vote for both ernst and the president in the fall he’s particularly concerned about rising health care costs associated with the affordable care act and the influence of money and corporations on politicians “i just want them to do what they say theyre going to do” vice said of elected leaders “im tired of all these years of being lied to” he said he couldn’t see himself voting for a democrat because he hasn’t seen them condemn the violence associated with protests after the death of george floyd in minneapolis floyd a black man died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes women supportive of greenfield greenfield leads 71 to 19 among likely voters who do not have a religious affiliation and 55 to 34 with those who live in cities she earns a plurality or majority of the vote in every congressional district except the 4th which is the most republicanleaning in the state women choose greenfield by 20 percentage points 54 to 34 white women without a college degree choose greenfield by an even larger margin 60 to 29 selzer said the gender gap for each candidate is striking “more women typically vote in elections than men she said and so if there is this kind of gap this kind of lead with the majority of voters its very difficult to overcome that except that recently the division is strong on both sides” while ernst leads 47 to 41 among those ages 35 to 54 greenfield leads with those younger than 35 46 to 40 and those 65 and older 50 to 42 each candidate is firmly backed by members of her own party ninetyfive percent of democrats say they will vote for greenfield and 90 of republicans say they will vote for ernst but independents are more likely to back greenfield with 42 saying they would support her and 38 saying they would support ernst terry dvorak a 49year old norwalk resident and independent said he voted for ernst in 2014 he said he remembers her advertising that she would “make ‘em squeal” in washington dc by cutting government waste but he said he’s been dissatisfied with her performance “it seems shes playing to the political lobbies of big corporations instead of the everyday iowan” he said “i think she has slipped right into the corrupt washington base i mean the whole administration is that way she fits in with trump which i dont like either that whole crowd is getting worse and worse to me us sen chuck grassley is in that boat too” the percentage of likely iowa voters who have an unfavorable view of grassley has hit a high according to the poll 34 say they have a very unfavorable or mostly unfavorable view of the senior senator — the highest its been since the register began tracking that number in 1998 another 48 say they have a very or mostly favorable view of grassley — the lowest for that number since 1998 about this poll the iowa poll conducted june 710 for the des moines register and mediacom by selzer co of

do the right thing then all you have to do is live with the consequences of it’”ap photosusan walsh washington ap — the general services administration ascertained monday that presidentelect joe biden is the “apparent winner” of the nov 3 election clearing the way for the start of the transition from president donald trump’s administration and allowing biden to coordinate with federal agencies on plans for taking over on jan 20 trump who had refused to concede the election said in a tweet that he is directing his team to cooperate on the transition but is vowing to keep up the fight administrator emily murphy made the determination after trump efforts to subvert the vote failed across battleground states citing “recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results” michigan certified biden’s victory monday and a federal judge in pennsylvania tossed a trump campaign lawsuit on saturday seeking to prevent certification in that state yohannes abraham the executive director of the biden transition said in a statement that the decision “is a needed step to begin tackling the challenges facing our nation including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track” he added “in the days ahead transition officials will begin meeting with federal officials to discuss the pandemic response have a full accounting of our national security interests and gain complete understanding of the trump administration’s efforts to hollow out government agencies” murphy a trump appointee had faced bipartisan criticism for failing to begin the transition process sooner preventing biden’s team from working with career agency officials on plans for his administration including in critical national security and public health areas “please know that i came to my decision independently based on the law and available facts i was never directly or indirectly pressured by any executive branch official—including those who work at the white house or gsa—with regard to the substance or timing of my decision” murphy wrote in a letter to biden trump tweeted shortly after her letter was made public “we will keep up the good fight and i believe we will prevail nevertheless in the best interest of our country i am recommending that emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols and have told my team to do the same” pressure had been mounting on murphy as an increasing number of republicans national security experts and business leaders said it was time for that process to move forward retiring tennessee sen lamar alexander who has repeatedly called for the transition to begin released a new statement monday saying that trump should “put the country first” and help biden’s administration succeed “when you are in public life people remember the last thing you do” alexander said republican sen rob portman of ohio on monday called for murphy to release money and staffing needed for the transition portman a senior member of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee also said biden should receive highlevel briefings on national security and the coronavirus vaccine distribution plan alexander and portman who have both aligned themselves with trump joined a growing number of republican officials who in recent days have urged trump to begin the transition immediately sen shelley moore capito rwva also urged a smooth transition saying in a statement monday that “at some point the 2020 election must end” meanwhile more than 160 business leaders asked murphy to immediately acknowledge biden as presidentelect and begin the transition to a new administration “withholding resources and vital information from an incoming administration puts the public and economic health and security of america at risk″ the business leaders said in an open letter to murphy advertisement separately more than 100 republican former national security officials — including former homeland security director tom ridge former cia director michael hayden and former director of national intelligence john negroponte — said in a statement that trump’s refusal to concede and allow for an orderly transition “constitutes a serious threat” to america’s democratic process the officials signing the letter worked under four republican presidents including trump the statement called on “republican leaders — especially those in congress — to publicly demand that president trump cease his antidemocratic assault on the integrity of the presidential election” trump had publicly refused to accept defeat and launched a series of losing court battles across the country making baseless claims of widespread voter fraud and seeking to overturn the election results murphy missed a deadline on monday set by house democrats to brief lawmakers about the delay in beginning the transition which is usually a routine step between the election and the inauguration a spokeswoman for the gsa said that a deputy administrator would instead hold two separate briefings for house and senate committees on nov 30 in response the democratic chairs of four committees and subcommittees said they could reschedule the meeting for tuesday but no later “we cannot wait yet another week to obtain basic information about your refusal to make the ascertainment determination” the democrats said in a letter to murphy “every additional day that is wasted is a day that the safety health and wellbeing of the american people is imperiled as the incoming bidenharris administration is blocked from fully preparing for the coronavirus pandemic our nation’s dire economic crisis and our national security” portman said it was “only prudent” for gsa to begin the transition process immediately “donald trump is our president until jan 20 2021 but in the likely event that joe biden becomes our next president it is in the national interest that the transition is seamless and that america is ready on day one of a new administration for the challenges we face″ portman wrote in an oped calling for the transition to begin murphy’s ascertainment will free up money for the transition and clear the way for biden’s team to begin placing transition personnel at federal agencies trump administration officials had said they would not give biden the classified presidential daily briefing on intelligence matters until the gsa makes the ascertainment official “now that gsa administrator emily murphy has fulfilled her duty and ascertained the election results the formal presidential transition can begin in full force” said max stier president and ceo of the nonpartisan partnership for public service “unfortunately every day lost to the delayed ascertainment was a missed opportunity for the outgoing administration to help presidentelect joe biden prepare to meet our country’s greatest challenges the good news is that the presidentelect and his team are the most prepared and best equipped of any incoming administration in recent memory” among those signing the letter from business leaders were jon gray president of the blackstone private equity firm robert bakish president and ceo of viacomcbs inc henry kravis the cochief executive of kohlberg kravis roberts co another private equity giant david solomon ceo at goldman sachs and george

Now She’s Voting for Biden.,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/carly-fiorina-vote-biden/613474/,asad1ali2,1077,33,read what happened to carly fiorina dovere abortion is an important issue for you trump says he’s been very committed to blocking abortion and has appointed judges in favor of restrictions biden wouldn’t be how do you reconcile what you see as an issue of life and death fiorina the vast majority of americans agree that abortion for any reason at all after five months is wrong and yet we haven’t made progress on that despite having pieces of legislation in front of us that’s because playing politics on the extreme you’re either prochoice and any abortion any time is okay or you’re prolife and there is no middle ground and we have to pass amendments on personhood we’re not making progress and so let’s focus on making progress where people agree and actually solving a problem of abortion after five months let’s start there and i’ve been public about that for a very very long time i would also say this that if we care so deeply about unborn life—and i do because i think every life has enormous potential and is gifted by god and i think abortion is used discriminantly against poor people and people of color—but if we care about life that’s unborn we need to care about life that’s in this world too and that means we actually have to make progress on criminaljustice reform and police reform and we have to stand up and recognize systemic racism and structural racism and make real progress on that because too many lives that are here are being wasted and ignored and dismissed and overlooked and sadly murdered in broad daylight dovere biden is a devout catholic and he’s struggled with his own position but he has moved toward fewer restrictions not more fiorina i think this is a great example of an opportunity to lead rather than just playing politics he could do that he could lead he could problemsolve he could find common ground on a bipartisan basis dovere we’re in a period of rethinking the economy what’s the fiscally conservative approach to rethinking the economy that you’d like to see fiorina what’s happened over decades and decades is big companies have used the power of big government to make their businesses bigger and more powerful and profitable that’s just a fact it’s true in many many industries and so we have to start with the fundamental recognition i believe as our founders told us it’s why they wrote the constitution the way they did power concentrated is power abused so you have big companies using big government you have wealthy individuals using the complexity of the tax codes all of those things—washington the way it’s structured favors the big the powerful the wealthy the connected and so that means in my view that wherever possible we blockgrant money to states instead of keeping it in washington dc i think we should have done that in the cares act and as we deal with the coronavirus it means that we have to have reasonable regulation that holds big companies accountable and that’s true whether it’s finance or energy or frankly technology and it also means i think that we have to take extraordinary care to help small businesses survive and to make sure that hourly workers have the opportunity to earn a living i think all those things are required now there are a lot of people who would listen to all that and say “boy you don’t sound like a republican” okay fine and maybe i don’t sound like a democrat either but i think those are the things that would actually work it is absurd i mean just take on one other issue it’s absurd what ceos are paid now as compared to hourly workers and the business community ought to take that on because if they don’t take it on eventually government is going to take it on and that’s not necessarily the right answer

rooting out and prosecuting fraud wherever we find it in this jan 14 2016 file photo retired us air force sr airman brian kolfage what started as an online fundraiser by kolfage to provide president donald trump with donations for his southern border wall has morphed into a new foundation whose members vow to build a wall themselves kolfages effort quickly went viral and raised millions of dollars from hundreds of thousands of donors – but gofundme threatened to suspend the campaign unless he identified a legitimate nonprofit organization into which those funds could be transferred according to the indictment kolfage a 37yearold triple amputee launched the crowdfunding campaign in late 2018 on gofundme to build the wall his effort came amid a stalemate over government funding on capitol hill where trump demanded that any spending package include billions of dollars to go toward the border barrier the deadlock culminated in the longest partial government shutdown in us history prior to his campaign to crowdfund the border wall kolfage had been involved in a string of farright news blogs and groups one of which had been scrubbed from facebook for allegedly using fake accounts to drive up website traffic some of the sites peddled false conspiracy theories and racist content as his wallfunding campaign gained national attention kolfage had frequently appeared on fox news and fox business where he defended trump and slammed his critics for suffering from trump derangement syndrome badolato notes on his own website that he has been an infrequent freelance contributor in the past to breitbart news a conservative news outlet bannon used to run badolato also says on his site that he was involved with a number of other conservative publications linked to

donated funds as alleged not only did they lie to donors they schemed to hide their misappropriation of funds by creating sham invoices and accounts to launder donations and cover up their crimes showing no regard for the law or the truth this case should serve as a warning to other fraudsters that no one is above the law not even a disabled war veteran or a millionaire political strategist according to the indictment1 unsealed today in manhattan federal court starting in approximately december 2018 brian kolfage stephen bannon andrew badolato and timothy shea and others orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors including donors in the southern district of new york in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign ultimately known as we build the wall that raised more than 25 million to build a wall along the southern border of the united states in particular to induce donors to donate to the campaign kolfage repeatedly and falsely assured the public that he would not take a penny in salary or compensation and that 100 of the funds raised will be used in the execution of our mission and purpose because as bannon publicly stated were a volunteer organization those representations were false in truth kolfage bannon badolato and shea received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donor funds from we build the wall which they each used in a manner inconsistent with the organizations public representations in particular kolfage covertly took for his personal use more than 350000 in funds that donors had given to we build the wall while bannon through a nonprofit organization under his control nonprofit1 received over 1 million from we build the wall at least some of which bannon used to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in bannons personal expenses to conceal the payments to kolfage from we build the wall kolfage bannon badolato and shea devised a scheme to route those payments from we build the wall to kolfage indirectly through nonprofit1 and a shell company under sheas control among other avenues they did so by using fake invoices and sham vendor arrangements among other ways to ensure as kolfage noted in a text

ic1nar,2020-08-18 17:07:51,JoeBiden,"Democratic insider Simon Rosenberg: Trump is ""being coached by Putin"" to seize power",https://www.salon.com/2020/08/18/democratic-insider-simon-rosenberg-trump-is-being-coached-by-putin-to-seize-power/,politicalthrow99,1051,44,the democratic national convention is taking place this week — but not exactly in milwaukee as originally scheduled for the first time ever both of this years majorparty conventions will be almost entirely virtual held online because of the pandemic with this event the 2020 presidential race is now entering its final stretch with less than three months to go until election day joe biden will now be formalized as the 2020 democratic nominee with sen kamala harris of california as his running mate she is the first black woman to be part of a presidential ticket and the third woman to be a vicepresidential nominee for a major party advertisement opinion polls show that biden and harris enjoy great support among democratic voters and hold a significant lead over donald trump and mike pence at this stage but these basic facts do not fully channel the malignant reality of america in the age of trump where we have seen a season of death from the coronavirus pandemic and the trump regimes criminally negligent response and now face a presidential election that will be a referendum on the future of the countrys multiracial democracy respect for human and civil rights and the rule of law as scholars like mike davis and chris hedges have reflected in recent interviews with salon the 2020 election is also a referendum on the future of the planet and the existence of the human race faced with the global climate disaster and the republican partys support for such ecocide in sum the american peoples decision on election day 2020 is a worldhistorical event these issues exist in a political environment of escalating rightwing political violence and the possibility of partisan mass violence on election day and beyond all of which is fueled by increasing social inequality conspiracy theory an enormous economic crisis a neofascist and white supremacist counterrevolution in america and a concerted effort by authoritarians to subvert or destroy empirical reality and replace it with an alternate reality molded in their image advertisement i recently spoke about all this with simon rosenberg president of the new democrats network and the new policy institute a liberal think tank based in washington he has served as a senior adviser to the democratic party at the highest levels and has worked in two presidential campaigns including a senior role in bill clintons 1992 war room in 2018 rosenberg was a senior adviser to the democratic congressional campaign committee and helped to craft the strategy which resulted in the democrats gaining 41 seats and the house majority in this conversation rosenberg shares his thoughts on what issues should be prioritized during the first 100 days of a joe biden presidency and explains his theory that donald trump isnt even trying to win the 2020 presidential election but rather hopes to steal it and then begin a fullon crackdown against any americans who dare to oppose him rosenberg also suggests that trump is being mentored by vladimir putin and other authoritarians — and then acting on that tutelage as he unleashes his federal secret police and conspires in plain sight to keep the american people from voting by various means including overt sabotage of the us postal service advertisement rosenberg also rejects the views of many progressives making clear that hes not part of the elizabeth warrenbernie sanders wing and arguing that the american people do not want radical change but rather a steady consistent compromiseoriented leader such as joe biden you can also listen to my conversation with simon rosenberg on my podcast the truth report or through the player embedded below advertisement as usual this interview has been edited for length and clarity how are you feeling about america in the age of trump and his escalating assault on democracy im scared prior to the 2016 election i wrote articles warning that donald trump could be far more destructive than most people understood particularly focused on questions he was raising about the propriety of the global liberal order and globalization it was likely that if he were to become president that he would end pax americana i was an adviser to the dccc and the dnc during the 2016 cycle so i was brought in by interim party chair donna brazile to help deal with some of the cleanup and mitigation after the carnage that happened at the dnc after the russian wikileaks hacking advertisement i knew the russian interference campaign was real because of my background working with the obama administration on tpp and the european ttip at the time the united states encountered the problems with edward snowden he became a problem because he was pushing the western alliance apart around questions of privacy and digital issues snowden was living in russia during all this and there is the question of whether he was a russian spy what we were witnessing at the time was the early stage of this ongoing operation to separate the united states from its allies and to weaken the west in 2016 the american intelligence community warned this was happening with their report stating that as part of its ongoing historic efforts to weaken the americanled global order russia launched a campaign to help donald trump get elected and then the report went on to call it an insurgency against the west and that it had to be seen that way trump and his campaign were mimicking russian arguments that america was not a truly virtuous power so i was worried going all the way back to the summer of 2016 that trumps relationship with russia was illicit and that if he won he would be dependent upon russia for the victory which means he was compromised putin would be able to exploit him putin is part of an ideological movement that is asserting itself in europe and the united states this movements goal is to weaken and destroy the united states advertisement i believe that 20 years from now mick mulvaney and mark meadows and the other chiefs of staff and senior trump officials are going to acknowledge that they believe that putin was trumps coach he has checked every play in the authoritarian playbook — and done it very fast donald trump is not very smart he is likely being coached by putin and other authoritarians they are giving him ideas and pushing him in certain directions we know that trump has spoken to putin seven times in the last few months in a time when he has ratcheted up his attacks on democracy and started the beginnings of a domestic crackdown here in the united states why did it take so long for the american news media and other elites including senior democrats to finally state that donald trump is an authoritarian and a threat to democracy why didnt the elites stop it why didnt the institutions hold people in the united states study authoritarianism from an academic and distant perspective and thought it could not happen here because of the countrys long history of being a stable democracy one of the biggest inhibitors for the democrats was that a political decision was made in the 2018 elections to not talk about trump and i was an adviser to the dccc in 2018 i was not an advocate of this strategy although it worked democrats won power in the house and it was a successful strategy but i have been an advocate that we needed to talk to the american people about what trump was doing to our democracy and the breaking of democratic norms and laws and rules advertisement in 2017 i was so concerned about trumps danger to this countrys democracy that i met with over 30 members of congress there were oneonone meetings with them and their staff to discuss how we as democrats needed to draw lines with the republicans and trump now there needed to be firm lines limits created which said that if donald trump goes over this line then we are going to cease all cooperation on other matters of government the democrats needed to make it clear that they were not going to allow any part of trumps agenda which was a threat to the countrys democracy in many of those meetings members of congress would say to me i dont think hes going to be that bad hes a businessman hes a pragmatist hes a dealmaker and we can work with him i would sit in the meeting and say in what universe have you been paying attention to what trump is saying about the russian scandal and election interference how he is covering up for putin there is a dark side to american exceptionalism which is that too many americans do not believe that authoritarianism can take hold in america but then again neither does any other country where authoritarianism takes over the american people have been naive in that regard joe biden is leading in the polls however there is a long time between today and the vote on election day in november hillary clinton led trump by double digits at times in 2016 and michael dukakis had a huge lead over george hw bush in 1988 i am deeply worried that too many democrats are prematurely celebrating a biden victory advertisement every election is unique the 2020 election has its own dynamic and i do not believe that donald trump can win this election any longer — which is why we should be worried about all of the antidemocratic activities that he is engaging in im growing concerned that trump is not even attempting to look like hes even trying to win the election anymore he is now attacking his political opponents using the government of the united states as a weapon trumps speeches over the independence day weekend must be taken seriously and literally in those speeches trump said that he viewed the hunting down and killing of the radical left in the united states to be a job equal in importance to getting rid of the soviet union and defeating the fascists in nazi germany trump said that directly he equated the socalled radical left with nazis and the soviet union that is a direct quotation from trump it is not an inference trumps threats must be taken at face value in that he is going to start a domestic crackdown — and then portland and his use of federal forces took place a week or so later trump and his administration and other allies have concluded that they cannot stay in power through voting and winning the election fairly and therefore trump needs to stay in power through other means i worry that what barr and trump have done over the last eight to 10 months is to create an ideological framework for authoritarianism and permanent rule by a tribal minority over a more multiethnic multiracial majority advertisement recent polling data shows that trumps voters are much more enthusiastic than are bidens supporters how concerned are you about that gap such observations are more important for political insiders than for the general public having said that i would rather have more supporters who are less enthusiastic then fewer supporters who are more enthusiastic donald trump is losing the election badly and we had very high turnout in the democratic party in the 2018 election and primaries since there is no reason to believe that the democrats are going to have a turnout problem voter intent is very high turnout is going to be high as well assuming that people have the ability to vote joe biden has a very substantial lead only a handful of candidates have been this far ahead barring some extraordinary set of events biden is in a very strong position their challenge is to continue to be on offense and being aggressive biden and the democrats cannot let donald trump dominate the news every day the democrats are going to have to fight to make sure that what theyre saying is heard and that theyre not getting overwhelmed by the trump media machine i believe that joe biden has run a very good campaign in some ways this is not the hardest election to run in because its going to be about covid and the economy and health care and a handful of other things this is not an election thats going to be about eight things its going to be about two things the biden campaign has to get those two things right they can do it the american people are not with donald trump on any of the major issues right now therefore the biden campaign must stand up and speak as loud as possible but they must not take anything for granted i believe that the democrats will win the presidency that the senate should flip and that democrats could extend the number of seats they hold in the house this is going to be a very good election for the democratic party based on all the underlying trend lines joe biden and the dnc helped to move the democratic party to the right he and the clintons were also central to the democratic partys embrace of neoliberalism that is serious baggage among a large part of the american electorate and the democratic partys base how would you advise biden about managing that history and its legacy the biden campaign is obviously listening growing and maturing i do not view bidens past as baggage the democratic party has been a very successful party over the last 30 years bidens been part of the most successful centerleft party in the modern world weve governed very well and left the country far better than we found it both times weve been in power its not been perfect — nobody is but id put up our track record of governing over the last generation of american politics against any political party in the developed world i do not believe that joe biden has a lot to run away from i do believe that the national conversation has changed things are different every election is about new opportunities and new challenges the biden campaign is doing a very good job of adapting itself to the moment joe biden is who he is and you cannot run away from the core reality that is part of what hurt hillary in 2016 there was a sense that she wasnt really being honest about her positions and how they had changed biden is running very much as joe hes in his 70s hes not going to go through some kind of radical change the important thing is that hes got to continue to present himself as running as the head of a competent and modern party where diverse voices will be heard biden made that very clear in the primaries that is the opposite type of leadership from trump i think theyre doing a really good job biden is running as the top democrat i dont think hes running a deeply ideological campaign the democrats are pragmatists they are focused on getting things done for everyday people and theyre not a deeply ideological party i think that thats important im not in the elizabeth warrenbernie sanders wing of the party i do not believe that voters are looking for massive transformation i think theyre looking for stability and incremental growth and a government thats on their side fighting for them every day the voters want government to work biden is willing to work with anybody hes willing to work with elizabeth warren hes going to work with republicans as well to pursue a winning agenda joe biden is a dealmaker and i think that frankly the country needs that right now its the opposite of trumps governing style which has been so dysfunctional and so hard to get anything meaningful done im optimistic that biden is in touch with the moment and his political team has kept him grounded and connected to todays democratic party and i think republicans are publicly backing joe biden in a way that they never would hillary because they know that even though theyre not on the same team if theyre in a room with joe he will listen and give them a chance to make their case bidens sense of fairmindedness and not being deeply ideological or partisan but rather being a leader who wants to do the right things for everyday people is what the american people want right now republicans need to be punished at the polls for their support of trumpism and its assault on american democracy civil rights human rights and the countrys standing in the world biden has suggested that he would try to make peace with good republicans and perhaps even put them in his administration why not exile the republican party from any significant role in american government society and public life after their cooperation with and loyalty to trump i do not support some type of fusion government but democrats have to get better at loving the sinner and hating the sin meaning that we have to distinguish between republicans who are good people and have contributed to the life of the nation versus an ideology that they currently advocate which has done enormous harm to the country i think we as democrats are agile enough do that i dont think its a pox on all your houses for backing trump i think what we want is a modern responsible centerright party in america we dont have that i dont think that joe bidens going to have the power to create that im of the belief theres a reasonable chance that the republican party goes out of business and some new centerright party is going to be formed i am unsure if it is possible to reform the republican party as it is right now on the question about how the crimes of the trump era are going to be prosecuted we must let the wheels of justice turn as they will claiming that were going to look the other way because of misdeeds by anyone in the trump administration would be a betrayal of justice much like what donald trump is doing i do not believe that joe biden and the democrats can walk away from trumps crimes and other misdeeds but there are also limits on what can be done many democrats are going to want to focus on defeating covid and fixing the economy and dealing with their broader agenda so how much time are we going to collectively spend on investigating and prosecuting the trump administration for wrongdoing yes what has happened in this country with donald trump and his time in office is so extreme that theres going to have to be a long and deep conversation about what happened so that reforms can be passed to prevent such an assault on democracy and the countrys political and social institutions from ever happening again the united states must strengthen its democracy and recommit to liberal values around the world there is a lot that has to come from this i think that part of it is going to be very complicated donald trump and postmaster general louis dejoy appear to be sabotaging mail delivery by removing mailboxes and sorting machines canceling overtime and engaging in other machinations with the goal of slowing down the mail such that mailin ballots will not arrive in time trump has made clear that he is interfering with the us mail in order to preventing the american people from voting against him the crisis is escalating will there be free and fair voting on election day trumps sabotaging of the usps is just one piece of a much broader campaign that trump is waging to hold onto power not by winning a free and fair election but through cheating its like a crime spree against democracy an orgy of antidemocracy behavior weve never seen before in america nothing could make the authoritarians of the world happier than to see the way trump is shredding american democracy in real time even though we all knew it was coming its clear we werent ready for this new assault we are in a very dangerous moment and folks have to stand up and fight what are your thoughts about sen kamala harris being chosen as joe bidens running mate there are many reasons picking sen harris was bold and smart but perhaps the most important is that it is a very clear embrace by biden of the emerging america an america far more tolerant and comfortable with its increasing diversity biden is in a very real way in the process of making the handoff of american leadership from one generation to another and working as a responsible leader would to ensure it is a successful transition what should biden do in his first 100 days in office i want him to be restrained and disciplined about staying focused on the things that matter most and not getting drawn in too many separate directions there are problems right now that matter more than other problems we have to defeat the pandemic we have to rebuild the countrys infrastructure and economy better and cleaner we have to repair our democracy we have to repair our standing in the world we have to start to lay out and create a big conversation about how we need to make our society better im worried that the democratic house passed hundreds of bills in the last two years but there has to be demonstrable and clear progress on the things that matter most to voters committing to these secondary issues that may matter a lot to constituents or specific groups may have to take a back seat to joe biden and the democrats getting the big stuff right we do not have the basic building blocks of a covid strategy in the united states we have to do that and thats going to be hard and complicated at the end of the day whats joe biden going to be evaluated on it will be whether he defeated the pandemic and how quickly the country was returned to normal

handle the coronavirus pandemic has soared since march in the latest abc newswashington post poll boosting biden – along with other measures – in the race for the white house three and a half months ago the two candidates were virtually even in trust to handle the pandemic trump 2 percentage points 4543 today with covid19 cases surging around the nation biden leads trump on the issue by a 20point margin 5434 see pdf for full results charts and tables biden’s also advanced nearly to par with trump in trust to handle the economy after trailing in march biden leads trump by 9 points on handling crime and safety a focal point of trump’s in recent weeks and on race relations biden leads by his largest margin 25 points 5833 biden has his own risks particularly a pronounced lack of enthusiasm for his candidacy yet the impact of that deficit remains to be seen for twothirds of his supporters it’s chiefly not about electing biden but about defeating trump the president moreover has other challenges ranging from performance assessments to personal attributes as reported friday approval of his handling of the pandemic has fallen from 51 in late march to 38 now with disapproval up 15 points he’s lost 7 points in approval of his handling of the economy to 50 with disapproval up 9 trump’s overall job approval rating is 39 in this poll produced for abc by langer research associates – down 9 points in the course of the pandemic with disapproval up 11 trump remains the first president in modern polling never to achieve majority approval for his work in office with the lowest career average on record rising disapproval of trump’s job performance is broadly based it’s up 22 points since march among those very worried about catching the coronavirus to 82 it’s also up in two of his key support groups 20 points among rural americans and 12 points among evangelical white protestants to 45 and 30 respectively disapproval also is up especially among southerners 18 points and blacks

also disapprove up 11 among republicans 16 disapprove up 10 points from late may beyond job approval biden leads trump by 26 points in being seen as having the better personality and temperament to serve as president in a related finding a vast 76 of americans say trump in talking about people he disagrees with “crosses the line in terms of what’s acceptable” fifty points fewer 26 say biden does the same sixtyone percent say trump has done more to divide than to unite the country more than said so about either of his two predecessors in office when asked which candidates would do more to unite americans biden leads by another wide margin 5733 biden leads by double digits on other personal attributes as well – better understanding the problems of people like you 17 points being more honest and trustworthy 14 better representing your personal values 12 and having a better idea of what america should stand for 10 trump pushes to parity on just one who’s the stronger leader an even 4545 split while views are similar among registered voters biden loses ground on three of these items among those who are likeliest to vote in the largest difference he goes from a 26point lead among all adults in having the personality and temperament needed to serve as president to a slight 11point edge among likely voters 5342 he also slips among likely voters in who better understands their problems and who’s the stronger leader vote preference these gaps in views of the candidates inform their current standings americans divide 5439 in biden’s favor if the election were today among registered voters the margin’s the same 5540 among likely voters biden still leads albeit by a closer 10 points 5444 signaling the customary gop advantage in turnout – potentially one of trump’s strongest weapons biden’s advantage among registered voters is up from a virtual dead heat 4947 in late march before the spiraling pandemic situation hammered trump’s ratings biden similarly was just 4 among registered voters in january as economic sentiment hit a 20year high that said what comes can go biden led trump by 17 points last october and 15 in september leads that he then relinquished only to fully regain his footing now trumps retreat since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak has been largest in one of his core groups rural americans with his lead among registered voters in this group shrinking from 47 points in late march to 18 points now 5638 as noted friday his rating for handling the pandemic also has fallen especially sharply in rural areas the race is 5243 bidentrump among suburbanites and 6827 in urban areas both essentially steady regional shifts also are substantial bidens advanced in the midwest from a dead heat to a 17point lead it’s close in the south 5044 bidentrump compared with a 13point trump lead in late march and biden is ahead by 15 points in the northeast and a broad 30 points in the west in a key center group biden leads by 5437 among independents unchanged from may but up from an even split in march biden now leads by 25 points among women double his margin in late march and is a nonsignificant 4 among men compared with 9 among men then this includes a broad 6036 biden lead among suburban women compared with a virtual dead heat among suburban men 4945 trumpbiden biden holds a 30point lead among college graduates 6333 vs 15 points in late march hillary clinton won this group by just 10 points in 2016 5242 and trump has gone from an 18point lead among white registered voters to a scant 4 points now while 94 of black registered voters support biden white catholics potentially a swing voter group divide essentially evenly 5147 trumpbiden vs 13 for trump in march trump won white catholics by 6137 in 2016 trump currently does better 6134 among noncollege white men but this is a group he won with 71 four years ago across the political spectrum collegeeducated white women favor biden by 6038 compared with their 5144 vote for clinton over trump in 2016 trump retains support from 90 of registered voters who say they voted for him in 2016 but loses 8 of them to biden biden for his part wins 95 of clinton’s 2016 supporters with 3 going to trump notably too biden wins registered voters who are very worried about catching the coronavirus by an overwhelming 8214 and those who are somewhat worried by a narrower 5341 those who are less worried by contrast prefer trump 6926 indeed in a statistical analysis called regression being worried about catching the coronavirus is a significant independent predictor of vote preference controlling for other factors including partisanship ideology and demographics mail it eightysix percent of registered voters say they’re certain to cast a ballot in the november election somewhat higher than typical at this point in recent cycles – it was 79 to 81 in july 2016 2012 and 2008 alike in what manner they’ll vote is another question thirtyeight percent of americans say they’d prefer to vote by mail 59 in person in 2016 for context 24 voted by mail according to the us election assistance commission it’s a key point of interest given efforts by some states to encourage mailin voting as a way to avoid virus infection at inperson polling places if mail balloting does surge counting those ballots could delay the vote count beyond election night trump has pushed back against mailin voting alleging that it’s open to fraud and the argument has some resonance fortynine percent see voting by mail as vulnerable to significant levels of fraud while 43 think adequate protections against significant fraud are in place partisanship divides these views among biden supporters just 28 see mailin voting as vulnerable to substantial fraud and 54 say it’s how they prefer to vote among trump supporters by contrast 78 see mailin voting as vulnerable and only 17 prefer to vote that way among people who prefer to vote by mail 23 see it as vulnerable to significant fraud this soars to 67 of those who prefer to vote in person other factors come into play preference to vote by mail is much higher in the west 56 likely reflecting its prevalence there vs as low as 25 in the northeast it’s also much higher among college graduates than nongraduates from how people vote to whom they vote for the course of the pandemic is a clear wildcard in the november election so as noted is the question of enthusiasm among registered voters who support trump 69 are very enthusiastic about doing so much better than it was for him in 2016 that compares with 39 enthusiasm for biden among his supporters to the extent that enthusiasm translates to turnout this could put biden’s current lead in jeopardy then again motivation for biden may come from another direction among trump’s supporters 72 say it’s more important to them to reelect trump than to defeat biden among biden’s supporters it’s almost the opposite sixtyseven percent say their main interest is to defeat trump allison de jong christine filer steven sparks and sofi sinozich contributed to this report methodology this abc newswashington post poll was conducted by landline and cellular

more than anywhere in america and glen murdoch couldn’t get his ballot in fast enough after becoming a us citizen this summer “i was champing at the bit” said murdoch who moved to austin from australia shortly after president donald trump took office and cast a ballot last week to vote him out it’s a rush to the polls in texas like seldom seen before ten days before election day texans have already cast as many early votes as they did in 2016 and are nearly 80 of the way toward hitting the total — both early and on election day — counted four years ago the voting bonanza has some democrats optimistic that decades of low turnout and undisputed republican dominance may soon be a thing of the past advertisement but what that it all means for texas is far from clear voters don’t register by party in the state making it difficult to know which party or presidential candidate has an edge polls are unusually close in texas but neither president donald trump or democrat joe biden has swung through texas focusing on clear battleground states instead like arizona and florida the striking numbers are across the board — in big cities that are solidly democrat in tippingpoint suburbs where republicans are losing ground and to a lesser extent in heavily latino counties along the border in harris county home to houston more than 1 million votes have already been cast democrats have long believed a breakthrough was only a matter of rousing millions of nonvoters particularly within the state’s booming latino population roughly 50 of voters currently registered to vote in texas have never voted or vote infrequently according to the voter information firm l2 a turnout surge could come with major political consequences democrats believe they have a shot at winning control of the statehouse a halfdozen competitive us house races and a senate seat not to mention 38 electoral votes that could seal the deal for biden republicans say democrats are getting way ahead of themselves as usual but are also cleareyed that the final turnout will likely be historic derek ryan a gop data analyst predicted this week that texas turnout would likely surpass 12 million or roughly 3 million more voters than 2016 — more than the population of neighboring new mexico “it’s hard to say ‘yes if we reach 12 million then democrats win’ because you never know” said abhi rahman a spokesman for the texas democratic party “but on balance yes if we reach 12 million voters we’ll win this election” advertisement republicans don’t buy it in austin’s fastgrowing suburbs williamson county went for trump by 9 percentage points four years ago gop county chairman steve armbruster said most of the county’s nearly 370000 registered voters now have no recent primary history he feels confident the gop will win a good chunk of them “i haven’t seen any kind of support or excitement or enthusiasm on the democrat side” armbuster said after returning from a local trump rally saturday the surge has unfolded at a moment when cases of the novel coronavirus blamed for more than 17000 deaths in texas are rising again and a wave of lawsuits over voting rules continue whereas the vast majority of states are allowing widespread mailin voting because of coronavirus fears texas is only one of five that refused choosing instead to expand early voting by one week that extended period helps explain texas’ huge numbers so far with still a week of early voting to go with most voters ineligible to submit ballots by mail the outcome in texas may be revealed sooner than other states on election night “we know from 2018 there at least a halfmillion people that don’t mind switching back and forth between parties as they go down the ballot and that’s a significant number” said steve munisteri a gop strategist and adviser to republican sen john cornyn who is in a close reelection battle against democrat mj hegar more than 56 million voters have already cast their ballot across the country and election experts are suggesting that as many as 150 million americans may vote in texas the focus is on suburbs where democrats made significant inroads in 2018 a major battleground is collin county outside dallas which has more than 1 million residents and backed trump by 17 percentage points in 2016 two years later democratic congressman beto o’rourke came within 5 percentage points of winning the booming county during his close but failed us senate run more than half of the county’s voters have already gone to the polls the highest rate in texas the same is true in neighboring denton county another traditional gop stronghold on saturday republican gov greg abbott made a second campaign swing this week through the north texas area that will be decisive in whether democrats claim a majority in the texas house for the first time in 20 years in heavily latino counties along the border turnout has not been as high as elsewhere in hidalgo county the percentage of registered voters who’ve already cast a ballot is slightly down from the same point four years ago in houston bob bailey cast his vote early for trump with only the economy in mind he hadn’t cut his shaggy hair in months but what worried him most about the pandemic was his job at a gymnastics center half his coworkers — roughly two dozen people — have been laid off and he said the business is only breaking even since reopening “my job everybody’s job” said bailey 60 ticking off his worries outside one of the more than 100 early voting centers around houston which is three times

protesters gather daily near the white house and the coronavirus pandemic rages on the american public is souring on president donald trump a new cnn poll conducted by ssrs finds trumps approval rating down 7 points in the last month as the president falls further behind presumptive democratic nominee joe biden whose support now stands at its highest level in cnn polling the survey also finds a growing majority of americans feel racism is a big problem in the country today and that the criminal justice system in america favors whites over blacks more than 8 in 10 also say that the peaceful protests that have spread throughout the nation following the death of george floyd at the hands of minneapolis police officers are justified americans now consider race relations as important a campaign issue as the economy and health care according to the survey overall 38 approve of the way trump is handling the presidency while 57 disapprove thats his worst approval rating since january 2019 and roughly on par with approval ratings for jimmy carter and george hw bush at this point in their reelection years both went on to lose the presidency after one term in the race for the white house among registered voters trump stands 14 points behind biden who officially secured enough delegates to win the democratic nomination in cnns delegate estimate on saturday the 41 who say they back the president is the lowest in cnns tracking on this question back to april 2019 and bidens 55 support is his highest mark yet the result comes amid a week in which trumps response to protests outside the white house led to condemnation from some fellow republicans and a rebuke from former defense secretary james mattis who served under the president the poll finds the public broadly disapproves of trumps handling of race relations 63 disapprove and 65 say the presidents response to recent protests has been more harmful than helpful a broad majority of americans say the peaceful protests happening all across the country after police violence against african americans are justified 84 say so and roughly a quarter 27 say violent protests in response to police harming or killing african americans are justified both figures are higher than they were when similar protests rose in the fall of 2016 then 67 saw peaceful protests as justified while 14 felt violent protests were there isnt much of a racial or partisan difference over whether peaceful protests are justified now but the gaps are larger over violent protests among democrats 42 consider violent protests justified in response to police violence against african americans while just 9 of republicans agree among blacks 39 say violent protest is justified vs 23 among whites twothirds of americans call racism a big problem in america today up from 49 who said so in a 2015 cnnkaiser family foundation survey the increase in this share has come most sharply among blacks 88 call it a big problem now vs 66 in 2015 but there have been large increases among latinos from 64 to 79 and whites from 43 to 60 as well theres also been an increase in the share who say the us criminal justice system favors whites over blacks 67 feel that way now up from 52 in the fall of 2016 about a quarter of americans 25 including a majority of blacks 54 say that they have at some point feared for their lives because of their race or ethnicity among black men 62 say that they have feared for their lives because of their race at some point and 63 of black americans of any gender under age 45 say the same with 42 calling race relations extremely important to their vote for president this fall the issue now stands on par with the economy and health care near the top of campaign issues the issue holds particular importance for democrats and democraticleaning independents 60 of whom call it an extremely important issue compared with just 18 of republicans and republicanleaners most black voters also call it extremely important 61 well above the 34 who said the same in june 2015 voters give biden a roughly twotoone advantage over trump on handling race relations 63 say they feel biden would do a better job on the issue just 31 choose trump among black voters biden is strongly preferred 91 say he would do a better job on the issue and just 4 feel trump would biden also outpaces trump overall on handling coronavirus 55 to 41 and on leading the nation in times of crisis 55 to 41 trump narrowly tops biden as more trusted to handle the economy 51 trust the president 46 biden support for trump is scarce outside his own party among independents 52 say they back biden for the presidency vs 41 for trump only 37 say they approve of his handling of the presidency and 68 feel his response to the protests has been harmful and any goodwill the president had earned among democrats appears gone only 1 of democrats say they would choose trump if the election were held today and just 2 of democrats now say they approve of the way trump is handling the presidency the worst measure of his presidency and matching the alltime oppositeparty low point in cnn or gallup polling back to roosevelt democratic approval of republican george w bush hit 2 in an october 2008 cnnorc poll those who are behind trump however remain enthusiastic about voting 73 say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting and mostly say their vote is a show of support for the president 70 say their backing of trump is more a vote for trump than against biden bidens voters have renewed their enthusiasm since the last cnn poll on that question in april while just 50 were extremely or very enthusiastic then 69 say the same now overall 53 of democrats now call themselves extremely enthusiastic about voting erasing a gap with republicans which had grown as large as 13 points in march those behind biden though are largely expressing opposition to trump 60 over support for biden 37 that result is not uniform though bidens black supporters are more likely than his white backers to say their vote is a nod of support 52 among black biden voters vs 33 among whites and the older voters behind him are likewise more apt to say they are for biden 51 among biden voters age 65 or older than against the president 47 among biden supporters under age 50 about twothirds say their support is to express opposition to trump the cnn poll was conducted by ssrs june 2 through 5 among a random national sample of 1259 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer including 1125 registered

democratic presidential candidate former vice president joe biden speaks during an event in dover del friday june 5 2020 biden has won the last few delegates he needed to clinch the democratic nomination for president ap photosusan walsh philadelphia ap — joe biden is adopting an increasingly aggressive stance as he looks to break out of a monthslong campaign freeze imposed by the coronavirus outbreak over the course of 24 hours the presumptive democratic nominee sharpened his rhetoric against president donald trump warning he could try to steal the election his campaign organized a petition pressing facebook to boost its efforts to prevent the spread of misinformation and he released a plan to restart an economy slammed by the coronavirus in a way that he says won’t make americans choose between their health and livelihoods advertisement the quick succession of developments signals biden’s growing desire to become more assertive he’s betting that he can build momentum by offering a contrast to trump’s leadership as the country is gripped by the pandemic economic turmoil and unrest stemming from racial injustice and police brutality “trump has basically had a onepoint plan open businesses” biden said thursday at an economic roundtable in philadelphia where he announced a plan to reopen the economy “it does nothing to keep workers safe to keep businesses able to stay open and secondly it does very little to increase consumer confidence” if elected biden promised to guarantee testing and protective equipment for people called back to work while prohibiting discrimination against elderly americans and others at high risk of contracting the virus he also wants to use federal funds to ensure paid leave for anyone who falls ill or cares for those who do he proposed a national contact tracing workforce or “job corps” of at least 100000 to call people who test positive track down their contacts and get them into quarantine that figure aligns with an estimate from the johns hopkins center for health security and the association of state and territorial health officials health experts agree that contact tracing is crucial to slowing the spread of the virus and that there aren’t enough public health workers today to achieve what’s needed biden also pledged a “nationwide pandemic dashboard” where americans could check the virus’ spreading by zip code josh michaud associate director of global health policy with the kaiser family foundation in washington said it remains unclear “if that information would be timely and accurate enough to reflect true levels of risk in a way that would be helpful to individuals businesses and institutions in each community” still “it might be helpful to have such information to better target resources and identify the most at risk communities on a more fine grain level” michaud said “as we have seen done in a few places like different new york city boroughs” biden backed more funding for schools and child care centers as they reopen and the creation of a “safe shopper” program meant to make returning consumers less wary of getting sick he referenced the potentially eyepopping price tag of all that joking “there goes that big spending democrat again” but added “if we don’t do this we’re going to be in deep deep deeper trouble economically” as the plan was being released his campaign circulated an online petition urging facebook to strengthen its misinformation rules social media giant twitter has already drawn trump’s ire by imposing stricter limits on how he and others use the social media network “we’re sending facebook a letter demanding that the company change its policies to crack down on misinformation in ads and ensure a fair election” the petition reads

and authorities say it’s safe melissa reed a spokesperson for trump victory in pennsylvania said voters “don’t want to return to the stagnant economic growth under the obamabiden administration they want a great american comeback under president trump” the president’s reelection campaign also criticized biden for offering a plan to jump start the economy “six weeks too late” biden’s economic proposals and facebook criticism followed him saying trump will attempt to “steal” november’s election “my single greatest concern this president’s going to try and steal this election” biden said on “the daily show with trevor noah” which aired wednesday night “this is a guy who said all mailin ballots are fraudulent voting by mail while he sits behind the desk in the oval office and writes his mailin ballot to vote in the primary” biden said he’d considered what would happen if trump refused to vacate the presidency in the event he wasn’t reelected before suggesting that the military could step in to ensure a peaceful transition of power “i am absolutely convinced they will escort him from the white house with great dispatch” he said white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany responded that biden was making “a ridiculous proposition” trump argues that absentee voting which many states are expanding to avoid large crowds at polling places during the coronavirus outbreak increases the possibility of fraud there is little evidence to support that assertion and trump himself has voted by mail in the past still a chaotic tuesday primary in georgia may foreshadow a messy

the worst president of modern times many voters might be willing to vote for almost anybody fortunately to oust president trump in 2020 voters do not have to lower their standards the democratic nominee former vice president joe biden is exceptionally wellqualified by character and experience to meet the daunting challenges that the nation will face over the coming four years those challenges have been to varying degrees created exacerbated or neglected by the incumbent the covid19 pandemic which has claimed more lives in this country than anywhere else in the world rising inequality and racial disparities a 21stcentury hightech authoritarianism ascendant in the world with democracy in retreat a planet at risk due to humancaused climate change underlying them all is the question of whether us democracy is any longer capable of meeting even one such challenge let alone a host of them here is where mr trump has done the most damage — and where mr biden is almost uniquely positioned for the moment he would restore decency honor and competence to america’s government in contrast to mr trump’s narcissism mr biden is deeply empathetic you can’t imagine him dismissing wounded or fallen soldiers as “losers” to mr trump’s cynicism mr biden brings faith — religious faith yes but also faith in american values and potential in place of mr trump’s belittling and demonizing of opponents and allies alike mr biden offers a deep commitment to finding common ground in service to making government work for the greatest number he has demonstrated that commitment in reaching across the aisle to republicans and also — most recently — in bringing unity to the democratic party without compromising his own fundamental convictions it is telling that when sen john mccain a republican was awarded the liberty medal at the national constitution center in 2017 the year before his death he asked mr biden to make the presentation on that occasion mccain recalled their service together in the senate where mr biden built a record of accomplishment as chair of the judiciary and foreign relations committees sen john mccain rariz shakes hands with former vice president joe biden after receiving the liberty medal in philadelphia on oct 16 2017 matt rourkeap “we didn’t always agree on the issues” mccain said “we often argued — sometimes passionately but we believed in each other’s patriotism and the sincerity of each other’s convictions… “we believed in our mutual responsibility to help make the place work and to cooperate in finding solutions to our country’s problems” mccain continued “we believed in our country and in our country’s indispensability to international peace and stability and to the progress of humanity” our democracy in peril a series of editorials on the damage president trump has caused mr trump’s negative example has demonstrated how essential in a president are decency empathy and respect for other human beings mr biden brings deep reservoirs of each but those qualities are not sufficient a president also needs toughness governing experience and good judgment does mr biden have what it takes this year’s campaign offers telling evidence mr biden took on some 20 aspirants many of them considered to be rising stars to considerable chatter about his past failed campaigns he finished fourth in iowa and fifth in new hampshire he had almost no campaign money little staff and if you believed many of the pundits no chance mr biden didn’t believe the pundits he stuck to his game plan took his fight to south carolina and won — there and then almost everywhere on super tuesday in defeating sen bernie sanders ivt he showed that the party hadn’t moved as far left as some were saying — and as mr trump continues baselessly to allege mr biden then oversaw a vicepresidential selection process that was free of leaks and unnecessary drama he chose as partner the woman who after the fact almost everyone agreed was the most qualified sen kamala d harris of california in setting aside her stinging attacks on him during the primary contest mr biden showed that he will govern based on merit not grudge all of that bodes well for a biden presidency but obviously voters do not have to judge by this year’s performance alone mr biden’s well of experience is far deeper joe biden joins sen kamala d harris calif on stage following her speech at the democratic national convention in wilmington del on aug 19 toni l sandysthe washington post if he takes the oath in the midst of the pandemic’s second wave as is quite possible with the economy in a tailspin we can be confident mr biden will rise to the occasion why because when president barack obama and he took office in 2009 the nation was in a similarly frightening tailspin mr obama trusted his vice president to work with congress to deliver a bipartisan recovery package and then to help administer it helping save america’s auto industry and the economy more broadly mr biden’s competence and honor are more important in this cycle than any particular stand on any particular issue but on the issues too mr biden offers the nation a welcome positive vision it is a vision that refutes both mr trump’s preposterous slander of mr biden as a “socialist” and the fears of some on the left that mr biden is aiming only at a restoration of the pretrump status quo the slander is not surprising mr trump — with few accomplishments in his first term and no agenda for his second — was bound to run a negative dishonest campaign but in fact mr biden has not succumbed to the wishes of the far left of his party at the same time the world is very different today than it was in 2008 — the challenge from china sharper the menace of climate change more imminent — and mr biden has shaped his agenda accordingly president barack obama speaks alongside vice president joe biden at the state department in january 2009 saul loebafp via getty images on climate change where mr trump denigrates scientists and dismisses warnings about a grave threat to humanity just as he did with covid19 mr biden understands that no issue is more fundamental to the longterm prosperity of the nation or the world he would make it a priority of his administration yet resisting more strident voices on the left he has declined to use the climate emergency to justify massive unrelated programs such as universal federal job guarantees or singlepayer health care instead he offers a credible plan for the right goal — making the country carbonneutral by midcentury mr biden similarly has shaped an ambitious and reformminded criminal justice agenda for today’s world he would set minimum standards for use of force and condition federal funding on meaningful police reforms his proposed 20 billion competitive grant program would incentivize states and localities to shift dollars from incarceration to crime prevention far from embracing socialism mr biden would better position the united states as a capitalist competitor to china he would do so by rolling back the least defensible of mr trump’s upwardly skewed tax cuts and investing more in education and research cooperating on trade with allies rather than spraying tariffs at south korea europe and canada and once again making the united states a welcoming destination for the brightest scientists and potential entrepreneurs around the world on foreign policy mr biden offers an enormously positive change from the trump administration simply by promising to rebuild longstanding us alliances and the global leadership that mr trump has willfully disrupted mr biden rightly observes that the struggle “of democracy and liberalism” to defeat “fascism and autocracy” is not over but “will define our future” “democracy” he has written “is under more pressure than at any time since the 1930s” — and mr trump “seems to be on the other team taking the word of autocrats while showing disdain for democrats” mr biden would convene a “summit for democracy” to unite democracies in “fighting corruption defending against authoritarianism and advancing human rights” he would rebuild relations with nato countries and help them stiffen defenses against russia he would end mr trump’s appeasement of russian president vladimir putin and coddling of arab dictatorships such as saudi arabia mr biden has a sober view of american power and its limitations like mr trump he speaks of stopping “endless wars” and bringing us military forces home from the middle east but mr biden rejects mr trump’s selfdefeating “america first” principle and would return to tackling global challenges in partnership with other nations he would rejoin the paris accord on climate change and seek to revive the nuclear deal with iran he would reverse mr trump’s senseless withdrawal from the world health organization and commit the united states to multilateral efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic that fundamental difference of approach may be most important when it comes to china which is likely to pose the biggest foreign policy challenge of the coming years both mr biden and mr trump promise to “get tough” with beijing and to combat its mercantilism thefts of technology and expansive claims in the south china sea however mr biden’s approach would be valuesbased not erratic and transactional he would work with allies to confront china’s abusive behaviors while seeking cooperation where interests converge such as on climate change and health security vice president joe biden and chinese vice president xi jinping talk at the white house on feb 14 2012 chip somodevillagetty images mr biden’s foreign policy offers insight into his technology policy as well he would stand up for this country’s belief in freedom and openness against the chinese brand of surveillance authoritarianism and he would fight to purge foreign interference by russia and others in elections rather than deny such interference exists mr biden promises to take a tougher line on socalled big tech in antitrust enforcement than his predecessor — but he would do so based on law and evidence not whim and favoritism democracy is at risk at home and around the world the nation desperately needs a president who will respect its public servants stand up for the rule of law acknowledge congress’s constitutional role and work for the public good not his private benefit just as desperately it needs a president with the knowhow and experience to show that values and results can go together it is

wednesday clearing joe bidens path to the democratic nomination and a showdown with president donald trump in november sanders first made the announcement in a call with his staff his campaign said i wish i could give you better news but i think you know the truth and that is that we are now some 300 delegates behind vice president biden and the path toward victory is virtually impossible sanders said in a livestream after the call so while we are winning the ideological battle and while we are winning the support of so many young people and working people throughout the country i have concluded that this battle for the democratic nomination will not be successful and so today i am announcing the suspension of my campaign see more sanders exit caps a stunning reversal of fortune following a strong performance in the first three states that voted in february the nomination appeared his for the taking until on the last day of february biden surged to a blowout victory in south carolina that set off a consolidation of moderate voters around the former vice president the contest ends now as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic which halted inperson campaigning for both sanders and biden and has led many states to delay their primary elections visit cnns election center for full coverage of the 2020 race sanders said he did not make the decision lightly describing it as a very difficult and painful decision over the past few weeks jane and i in consultation with top staff and many of our prominent supporters have made an honest assessment of the prospects for victory if i believed we had a feasible path to the nomination i would certainly continue the campaign but its just not there he said sanders departure from the race is a sharp blow to progressives who rose up during and after the 2016 campaign and commanded the democratic partys trump era debates over issues like health care climate change and the effects of growing economic inequality few would deny that over the course of the past five years our movement has won the ideological struggle sanders said on wednesday it was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe today they are mainstream ideas many of them are already being implemented in cities and states across the country but even as his policies grew more popular over the years and into the primary season the vermont senator struggled to broaden his own support and galvanize a winning coalition now as he did after leaving the 2016 primary sanders will seek to influence the presumptive nominee through the means he knows best from the outsidein biden has already made gestures toward sanders populist base which formed a movement over the past five years that could be critical to defeating trump in the fall whether the former vice president will take the necessary steps to win over the holdouts and the extent to which sanders goes to make the case will be a running subplot until election day sanders decision to remain on the primary ballot in order to amass as many delegates as possible as part of an effort he said to exert significant influence over the party platform and other functions at this summers convention underscores the depth of the divisions both he and biden still have to bridge sanders and biden spoke wednesday morning with the vermont senator telling the former vice president about his decision to end his presidential campaign according to people familiar with the call in a statement after sanders announcement biden called the senator a powerful voice for a fairer and more just america and said his campaigns impact on the election is far from over he also made an explicit call for sanders supporters to join him and to sanders supporters i make the same commitment i see you i hear you and i understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country i hope you will join us you are more than welcome youre needed biden said sanders also acknowledged on wednesday that some of his supporters would be disappointed by his exit see more i know that there may be some in our movement who disagree with this decision who would like us to fight on until the last ballot cast at the democratic convention i understand that position he said but as i see the crisis gripping the nation exacerbated by a president unwilling or unable to provide any kind of credible leadership and the work that needs to be done to protect people in this most desperate hour i cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour the pivot from four and fiveevent days came abruptly last month as americans attempted to combat the coronavirus by staying sometimes on state and local leaders order inside their homes the sanders campaign held its final live public event on march 9 transitioning from packed raucous rallies to an entirely digital operation he communicated almost exclusively through virtual town halls and livestreams focused on the coronavirus crisis and how his progressive agenda headlined by medicare for all might have prevented it or helped cushion the blow it was a point he returned to on wednesday morning this current horrific crisis we are now in has exposed for all to see how absurd our current employerbased health insurance system is sanders said the current economic downturn we are experiencing has not only led to a massive loss of jobs but has also resulted in millions of americans losing their health insurance even in the end the message remained the same for sanders supporters though the context was jarring less than two months ago the vermont senator appeared poised to run away with the nomination after a strong performance in iowa and victories in new hampshire and nevada the latter by more than 25 percentage points on the strength of his popularity with latino voters which had been courted relentlessly by his campaign but sanders momentum was dashed in south carolina biden routed the field and then cleared it the antisanders vote rallied around him and even with sanders win in california put biden in the drivers seat on super tuesday the wind at his back the former vice president duplicated the feat a week later delivering the hammer blow in michigan a state sanders won in 2016 and viewed as crucial to his prospects in 2020 a day earlier public safety measures in response to the coronavirus effectively ended the campaign roadshow sanders would return to vermont where he has spent most of his time since while biden set up headquarters at home in delaware the sanders fundraising machine the most successful grassroots donor effort in american political history was over the last month repurposed into a feeder for public health groups fall and rise and fall sanders addresses supporters during a campaign rally on march 8 2020 in ann arbor michigan sanders entered the race in february 2019 as an early frontrunner in an email announcing his second run for the presidency he asked voters to join me today as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least a million people from across the country he would quickly hit and surpass that goal and raise throughout the campaign more money from small dollar donors than any candidate in american political history his status atop the early polls before biden got in the contest and claimed the lead underscored the power sanders had built up since beginning his first presidential campaign as a littleknown lawmaker from vermont who freely called himself a democratic socialist by the end of the 2016 race sanders emerged as one of the most influential figures in democratic politics his policy agenda a suite of progressive proposals including medicare for all tuition free public college and the green new deal set the terms of debate among the 2020 candidates despite entering with a head start on the field sanders second campaign encountered some early headwinds as democratic voters sampled a diverse array of candidates many of them offering pieces of the progressive vision that sanders popularized by the late summer sanders appeared to be falling behind fellow progressive elizabeth warren his senate colleague from massachusetts a campaign on its heels would be knocked to the pavement in early october when sanders had a heart attack while campaigning in nevada but what many supporters and staff feared would be the end turned out to be a springboard sanders recovered quickly and before leaving las vegas received a call from rep alexandria ocasiocortez the young progressive star who had been intensely courted by warren told sanders she was endorsing him her early events for sanders in iowa were electric but as the primary heated up her appearances become fewer and further in between an early sign of the tactical tensions that would face the left in the coming months still for a campaign that had scuffled through the summer and into the fall it felt at least for that moment in midoctober moment as if a switch had been flipped sanders returned to the trail only a couple weeks after falling ill and after turning in a sterling debate performance in ohio on october 15 began to climb in the polls days later in a packed riverside park in queens new york after being introduced by ocasiocortez and taking the stage to acdcs back in black sanders addressed one of his largest and most diverse audiences of the campaign take a look around you and find someone you dont know maybe somebody that doesnt look kinda like you maybe somebody who might be of a different religion than you maybe they come from a different country he said aides who had driven and flown in from around the country looked on rapt like his supporters some of them watching from across the streets after the park hit its capacity my question now to you is are you willing to fight for that person who you dont even know sanders said as much as youre willing to fight for yourself the question and the call would be a centerpiece of his campaign in the weeks and months that followed ocasiocortez who looked on as he said those words tweeted in praise of sanders after the decision was made public thank you bernie for doing your best to fight for all of us from the beginning for your entire life she wrote thank you for fighting hard lonely fights in true devotion to a peoples movement in the united states thank you for your leadership mentorship and example we love you a quick unraveling supporters of democratic presidential hopeful vermont senator bernie sanders cheer during a rally at houston university in houston texas on february 23 2020 as biden in the aftermath of south carolina lined up support and endorsements from moderates across the board sanders was unable to do the same with the progressive wing of the party warren buoyed by the latearriving support of a super pac stayed in the race through super tuesday she dropped out the following thursday but despite being so closely aligned with sanders on policy chose to stay on the sidelines instead of putting her support behind his struggling campaign though some sanders supporters lashed out at warren for not immediately backing him the writing had been on the wall the pair had been close as political figures go though they took fundamentally different views of how to win and exert power but the controversy over whether sanders told warren in late 2018 that he did not believe a woman could win the presidency which she confirmed and he denied cut off meaningful communications between the campaigns in the end and as many on both sides acknowledged privately at the time it was already too late warren on wednesday tweeted in praise of sanders and the impact of his two presidential campaigns your fight for progressive ideas moved the conversation and charted a path for candidates and activists that will change the course of our country and party she wrote after losing five of the six contests on march 10 including michigan and all three primaries on march 17 sanders campaign manager faiz shakir signaled the beginning of the end sanders he said in a statement is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign but that in the immediate term however he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak sanders batted away questions about the future of his campaign through the latter half of march as his campaign with the exception of a handful of combative surrogates and staff who continued to batter biden largely retrained its focus on the coronavirus asked about his plans during a recent visit to capitol hill sanders bristled telling cnn im dealing with a fking global crisis by then his livestream conversations and other campaignadjacent online events rarely made mention of the primary or biden as sanders started to make more television appearances after leaving washington he became increasingly frank about his chances of winning the nomination there is a path it is admittedly a narrow path sanders told late night host seth meyers last week but those acknowledgments were mixed in with public arguments for staying in the race and other remarks more difficult to discern that offered some insight into sanders own indecision i mean right now under normal times i wouldnt be talking to you from my home sanders told cnns anderson cooper in an interview on friday so yes the calculus has absolutely changed and you know were talking to a lot of people and trying to figure out the best way forward toward the end the questions often appeared to shape the answers after being pressed by whoopi goldberg on the view last week over his reasons for remaining in the race sanders sounded like he was settling in for a longer haul last i heard people in a democracy have a right to vote he said and they have a right to vote for the agenda that they think can work for america but in his livestream events conducted with top aides advisers and friends sanders was more expansive the pandemic he argued had pulled the tide out and revealed in the starkest ways possible the ugliest inequities in american life i think it is not inappropriate to be trying to ask ourselves how did we get to where we are today and maybe where we want to go when all this is behind us sanders said on april 4 and i think some of the questions that we have to ask ourselves and you have heard me say this a million times is how does it happen that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right he spoke with former president barack obama in the last few weeks as he determined the future of his campaign a source familiar with the conversation tells cnn obama throughout the 2020 democratic primary had regular conversations with candidates including before during and after their respective bids his private counsel consistently emphasized staying focused on the ultimate goal winning the white house in november the source familiar with obamas calls tells cnn he was impressed by the caliber of our candidates and the strong campaigns they waged but always urged them to keep in mind that we must be wellpositioned to unify as a party once we have a nominee five years after sanders launched a message campaign with the hope of rejuvenating progressive grassroots and keep hillary clinton accountable to the democratic partys left flank and after that bid touched off a movement that has spawned a new generation of leftist leaders sanders by the end of his 2020 race had in many ways returned to his own beginnings whether sanders decision to the leave the contest now rather than carrying on as he did in 2016 through the end of the primary calendar will earn him some goodwill with the party establishment he fought so long and hard to upend is an open question an earlier departure wont blot out the ideological divisions that have roiled the party since 2016 but the more immediate question facing sanders following his departure and his supporters is whether and to what extent they will lend their support and organizing energy to bidens campaign sanders has been insistent that he would support the eventual nominee no matter who it was but his political base especially the young who voted for him by overwhelming margins and disaffected will be more difficult to bring along no matter how many miles sanders covers on bidens behalf this story has been updated

democrats west long branch nj – american voters are simultaneously confident and concerned about the integrity of the upcoming election while many democrats are worried about russian meddling republicans think the democratic party will be responsible for any election interference the monmouth “monmuth” university poll also finds that joe biden currently holds a 10point lead over donald trump in the presidential race biden is currently supported by 51 of registered voters and trump by 41 the remaining vote is scattered across thirdparty candidates including libertarian jo jorgensen 2 the green party’s howie hawkins 1 and other candidates 1 while 4 of voters are undecided this is similar to the democrat’s late june lead of 52 to 39 with thirdparty candidates named and 53 to 41 without thirdparty candidates named biden’s edge stood at 52 to 41 in early june 50 to 41 in may 48 to 44 in april and 48 to 45 in march slightly more voters say they are certain about their support for biden 39 than say the same about trump 35 this is similar to the “firm support” gap in late june when it was 40 biden to 34 trump fully half 50 of registered voters continue to say they are not at all likely to support the incumbent identical 50 in late june while 40 say the same about the challenger 39 in late june “trump has stopped his slide in the poll but biden maintains a lead among all registered voters nationally” said patrick murray director of the independent monmouth university polling institute voter opinion of biden stands at 42 favorable and 47 unfavorable it was 44–44 in

favorable opinion of biden only 37 have a favorable opinion of trump only and 3 have a favorable opinion of both just over 1 in 5 registered voters 22 though do not have a favorable opinion of either

majorities of democrats 78 republicans 66 and independents 70 overall 39 of american voters express both confidence and concern in how the upcoming election will be run democrats 47 are more likely than republicans 36 and independents 33 to feel this way while majorities of all partisan groups are concerned about potential election meddling they differ over the expected causes a sizable number of democratic voters who are worried about possible election meddling believe a foreign power will be involved with 40 pointing the finger at russia while 9 name china and 4 name another country far fewer republicans though expect election interference from outside our borders 12 china 6 russia and 3 another country a significant number of democrats also expect that trump 31 along with the republican party 16 will play a role in possible election meddling government election officials 5 as well as the post office 2 are also mentioned by concerned democrats as potential culprits a majority 55 of gop voters on the other hand believe the democratic party would be the most likely perpetrator of any election interference another possible cause named by republicans is votebymail 11 also 4 of republicans name biden 2 name trump 2 name the republican party and 2 cite the media as potential sources of election meddling “the us intelligence community has been unambiguous in calling out russia and to a lesser extent china for both past and planned election interference however the trump camp has been fairly successful in deflecting their supporters away from these actors and instead focusing on democratic efforts to expand voting access” said murray a majority 58 of american voters think it is a good idea to make it easier to cast ballots by mail this year another 37 say this is a bad idea nearly all democrats 90 say expanding votebymail is a good idea but few republicans 20 agree six in ten 60 independents say it is a good idea nearly half of all voters report they

finds that 64 of voters feel optimistic about the 2020 presidential election voter optimism was somewhat lower 55 in august 2016 just after both parties’ nominating conventions the shift in the current numbers is due mainly to republicans – 81 feel optimistic now versus 61 in august 2016 the 4year trend on this question is basically unchanged for democrats 66 now and 67 in 2016 and independents 48 now and 40 in 2016 currently 40 of american voters feel more enthusiastic about this election compared to past elections 17 are less enthusiastic and 43 say they feel about the same level of enthusiasm there was far less enthusiasm four years ago when 21 felt more enthusiastic 46 less enthusiastic and 31 about the same while republicans are largely responsible for the increase in

confident biden does slightly better at 16 very confident and 32 somewhat confident versus 12 not too confident and 36 not at all confident “this is the type of result we have been seeing on issue questions throughout the campaign voters tend to have strongly held views of trump both positive and negative biden does slightly better in the net ratings overall it’s just that voters don’t have as

likes to insist that he brings people together and in at least one sense that is true he gave me the unexpected gift of temporary political kinship with conservatives who are putting aside long held policy goals in the interest of a larger mission rescuing american values principles and democracy this group ranges from nationally known republicans like john kasich cindy and meghan mccain carly fiorina and colin powell to conservative columnists like george will michael gerson and bret stephens to the inyourface nevertrump strategists of the lincoln project to the ordinary voters who say they made a mistake in 2016 there is nothing like a common adversary to make people recognize what they have in common once there was consensus that civility compassion immigration equal opportunity and foreign allies were good that racism misogyny discrimination voter suppression and foreign autocrats were bad that respect for the us military the intelligence community political leaders science the constitution and the rule of law was a given that the american promise was based on good faith compromise and checks and balances and that presidents should be role models patriotic enough to switch sides there will never be a liberalconservative consensus on abortion or guns or how people should get health care or even if the government should make sure they have insurance and it’s hard to envision agreement on taxes given the continuing grip of a conservative economic philosophy that aggravates inequality rather than trickling down to those who need help but that’s what makes it remarkable to me that people are willing to give up on these convictions for now to vote for democrats joe biden and kamala harris and cross their fingers that the new administration won’t find a way to enlarge the supreme court launch medicare for all and make washington dc a state — on day one would i be this honorable if our situations were reversed in 1998 when bill clinton was president and facing impeachment the usa today editorial board at the time urged him to resign i was a news reporter back then and couldn’t express a public opinion but in private i had no mercy i wanted him to step down the sooner the better yet what did i really have at stake al gore would have stepped into the presidency with less baggage a similar policy agenda and a better chance to advance it see less baggage he would have run in 2000 as the incumbent of a party that had proved its seriousness by dispatching a flawed president — instead of as a dutiful vice president who never really was able to separate himself from the character questions dogging clinton and that might have made all the difference in that election when gore won half a million votes more than bush but lost because a surreal florida recount and supreme court decision handed george w bush a 537vote victory and the presidency compared with clinton who had an affair with an intern and tried to cover it up the moral choice on trump is glaringly obvious but the political calculation is far more complicated former new hampshire gop chair my fellow republicans trump does not deserve your loyalty whereas clinton had decided to reinforce his own youth centrism and southern roots by choosing a running mate like him trump took the more traditional path of balancing the ticket with mike pence — religious conservative and midwestern with a conventional political résumé he’s no match for the personal or political force that is trump the staid former indiana governor has no hold on trump voters who are fanatically loyal precisely because trump breaks rules and annoys liberals and who believe him when he says falsely that he has done a great job on covid19 and reducing the deficit meanwhile trump has kept many economic and social conservatives on his team by delivering the tax cuts and supreme court justices at the top of their wish lists and keeping new gun restrictions off the table despite horrific mass shootings during his term could i abandon my party for america i try to imagine democrats nominating and electing a president as unfit as trump it’s unthinkable but what if we did i try to imagine voting a toptobottom slate of republicans in 2018 and that too is unthinkable yet my sparring partner on politics libertarian conservative david mastio who opposes gun restrictions and legal abortion as strongly as i support them voted a straight democratic ticket that year in virginia “﻿i never thought the day would come but things more fundamental than policy were on the ballot things like decency and democracy itself” he told me policy just doesnt matterwhy this never trump exrepublican will vote for almost any 2020 democratic nominee i try to imagine setting aside what keeps me awake at night our massively frustrating struggles to do what other countries consider the minimum for keeping their people healthy and productive child care health care paid family leave a robust national public health response to a crisis like the coronavirus and more fairness voting that’s easy and convenient for everyone courts that reflect our country and its will as expressed in elections and yes statehood for my taxed but unrepresented home of dc would i accept that these imperatives festering without results for decades must be put on hold that nothing is more important than saving an america in peril i hope i would now there is an admirable example to follow jill lawrence is the commentary editor of usa today and author of the art of the political deal how congress beat the odds
