      "{'https://www.vogue.com/article/7-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-senate-runoff-races-in-georgia': 'for the first time in us history two runoff races for senate seats will be held simultaneously in the state of georgia with the outcome likely determining which party will control the senate when presidentelect joe biden is inaugurated on january 20 the races to be held in the middle of donald trump’s increasingly chaotic final days—with the president continuing to push baseless claims that the presidential election was stolen from him—pit two surging democrats jon ossoff and reverend raphael warnock against two republican incumbents david perdue and kelly loeffler at stake is the balance of power in the us senate if ossoff and warnock win the senate will be split 5050 with vice president–elect kamala harris having the power to cast the deciding vote if perdue and loeffler win the republicans will hold a slim 5248 majority made even more precarious by the possibility that one or more senators will be struck by covid in the coming months rendering them unavailable for floor votes at least a half dozen republican senators have already tested positive for the coronavirus in the past few months including loeffler herself here is what you need to know about these most unusual of senate races both of which will be held on january 5 with advance voting starting on december 14 why are two races being held at once perdue’s sixyear term came up in 2020 and ossoff a former investigative journalist who narrowly lost a highprofile us house special election in 2017 quickly emerged as the strongest democratic challenger loeffler was appointed to the senate in 2019 by georgia governor brian kemp taking the seat that senator johnny isakson vacated for health reasons and was required to run in the next general election in order to fill out the remaining two years of isakson’s term why are there runoffs georgia election law requires that the winning candidate claim 50 of the vote or else a runoff is required perdue came close winning 49 in what was largely a twoman race between him and ossoff but the race for isakson’s seat was a freeforall with 20 candidates vying for election warnock the senior pastor at atlanta’s historic ebenezer baptist church came in first with 33 of the vote and loeffler came in second representative doug collins a trump favorite finished out of the running in third place and has since endorsed loeffler what are the main campaign issues as he did in the general election ossoff is trying to make an issue of perdue’s highly questionable stock trades in which the senator seemed to financially benefit from the coronavirus pandemic in addition the daily beast recently reported that perdue invested in a company called bwx technologies that manufactured navy submarine parts right around the time he became head of the senate armed services subcommittee on seapower perdue’s office told the daily beast that perdue’s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval ossoff has also hammered hard on perdue’s opposition to the affordable care act and the larger issue of the need for financial relief for those made newly unemployed by the pandemic in addition ossoff is having fun tweaking perdue for his refusal to debate him a decision the sitting senator apparently made following his largely disastrous performance in the one debate held during the general election “perhaps senator perdue would have been able to respond properly to the covid19 pandemic” ossoff said as perdue began to visibly squirm “if you hadn’t been fending off multiple investigations for insider trading” as for loeffler reportedly the wealthiest person in the senate she too has made some questionable trades according to published reports loeffler and her husband jeffrey sprecher who is the ceo of a company that owns the new york stock exchange reportedly sold 20 million in shares after she attended a closeddoor senate briefing on the coronavirus in january while also making investments in companies that may benefit from the pandemic like perdue loeffler has said her investments are managed by an outside adviser without her involvement this summer the senate ethics committee found that loeffler did not violate senate regulations with her trades one other factor on the campaign trail is some of the the positions loeffler has taken in her short time in the senate—like introducing legislation to strip federal dollars from cities that defunded their police department and calling black lives matter an organization of “trained marxists”—that have become flash points in a race against someone who if elected would be the first african american to represent georgia in the us senate she has also sparked very visible opposition from present and former players on the atlanta dream the wnba team that loeffler coowns because of her statements on black lives matter do the two democrats have a chance to flip the senate georgia last elected a democratic senator in 1996 when max cleland was narrowly elected only to lose six years later to republican saxby chambliss but notably the last time the state voted for a democratic candidate for president was in bill clinton’s first race in 1992—and joe biden changed that this year can ossoff and warnock do the same a november 17 insideradvantagefox 5 atlanta poll found both races essentially even with warnock one point ahead of loeffler 49 to 48 and ossoff and perdue tied at 49 but as we know from the recent presidential elections polls have become notoriously unreliable and republicans are pointing to a state like maine—where biden won the presidential race but susan collins was handily reelected over a wellfinanced democratic challenger—as an example in which local races still favor the gop establishment plus democrats have had an unlucky track record in runoff races in the state but the changing nature of the populace over the past few years making georgia a more purple state is giving democrats hope “there is a demographic change happening in georgia that is only accelerating every year” a democratic strategist who has worked on senate races in georgia recently told the washington post “the state is diversifying and urbanizing at an incredible clip” will donald trump be a factor although vice president mike pence visited the state for a campaign rally with perdue and loeffler last month trump has stayed almost completely silent about the georgia race so far focusing instead on his increasingly unhinged efforts to try to overturn the results in the presidential race which gave joe biden georgia’s 16 electoral college votes and for good measure he has begun attacking governor kemp as trumpian a candidate as you could have found two years ago for not being supportive enough in his attempts to challenge the georgia results “he’s done absolutely nothing” trump said in a fox news interview this past weekend “i’m ashamed that i endorsed him” but trump has just announced plans to campaign in the state this week will it help it’s hard to imagine someone screaming about “voter fraud” and a “fixed election” actually encouraging his followers to go to the polls will stacey abrams come to the rescue again if the democrats are to win turnout is key particularly in counties like fulton and gwinnett in the greater atlanta area which were key to biden’s razorthin victory in the state that surge of newly democratic votes is largely attributable to the efforts of stacey abrams who after narrowly losing the 2018 governor’s race to kemp has spent the last two years focusing on ballot access and voter registration particularly in the african american community abrams built a network of organizations including new georgia project and fair fight that highlighted past voter suppression in the state and helped register an estimated 800000 new voters in georgia and it’s clear that abrams can make an impact here according to the new york times in the first week following the general election abrams led an online fundraising effort that brought in nearly 10 million in contributions for the ossoff and warnock campaigns in an interview with the atlanta journalconstitution ossoff acknowledged the key role that abrams could play in the runoffs “stacey’s efforts will be vital to our success in these runoffs” ossoff told the paper “her resources volunteers her presence on the campaign trail and her strong investment in dual victories here are absolutely essential and i’m honored by her support and grateful for all that she is doing”', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/what-do-u-s-senate-runoffs-georgia-have-do-puerto-n1250033': 'as georgias gop sen david perdue was forced into a runoff with democrat jon ossoff republicans warned about what is at stake in the coming election statehood for puerto rico for those who tuned out after presidentelect joe biden defeated president donald trump the election frenzy hasn’t stopped instead it has consolidated in georgia where future control of the us senate will be decided the state has seen a burst of campaign messaging spin and rhetoric around incumbents perdue and sen kelly loeffler also a republican as they attempt to defeat their respective democratic challengers ossoffand the rev raphael warnock one of the first missives was in a press release from the national republican senatorial committee the gop senators’ political arm with the puerto rico warning nrsc spokesperson paige lindgren stated in the nov 11 release that the change ossoff and democrats have said they will make is “a path straight to socialism” that “includes extreme ideas like statehood for dc and puerto rico” in a nov 24 statement the republican party stated ossoff supports statehood for dc and puerto rico and is open to ending the filibuster in the senate as one of its bullets in a research briefing that was titled ossoff and warnock are too extreme for georgia with those statements republicans weren’t taking a stand on puerto rico’s longstanding debate over whether the island should maintain its us territory status become a us state or be wholly independent the gop had already done that in its party platform in 2016 and repeated it in 2020 when it kept the same platform in place the platform states that republicans “support the right of the united states citizens of puerto rico to be admitted to the union as a fully sovereign state” but for about a year as republicans became fearful of losing their majority in the senate the statehood of puerto rico and the district of columbia began to be equated with socialism and the senate majority “they plan to make the district of columbia a state — that would give them two new democratic senators — puerto rico a state that would give them two more new democratic senators senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky said this is full bore socialism on the march in the house his office later said his statement was intended to warn about democratic overreach but others continue to equate the two lindgren of the nrsc did not respond to emails requesting comment democrats have said that with the majority they would push for selfdetermination for puerto rico a bill on puerto ricos status introduced by democratic reps alexandria ocasiocortez and nydia velázquez drew backlash reflecting the issues complexity and the grueling debate that can accompany it last month’s elections have left the senate split 4850 between democrats and republicans respectively making it possible for democrats to gain control by winning one of georgia’s senate runoffs vice presidentelect kamala harris a democrat has the tiebreaking vote puerto rico status not a partisan casino chip the thinking that statehood for puerto rico means more democrats is flawed the politics of puerto rico are shaped in a large way by the question of whether the territory should continue in that status push to become a state or become an independent nation puerto ricans dont split their views on the issue based on the politics of the mainlands main parties puerto rico’s recently reelected nonvoting resident commissioner in congress del jenniffer gonzálezcolón is a republican and one of the chairs of latinos for trump shes also one of the islands most visible prostatehood proponents pedro pierluisi who was elected puerto rico’s governor is a democrat but like gonzálezcolón hes a member of the new progressive party which supports statehood federico de jesús — a democratic consultant principal of fdj solutions and a puerto rico native — expressed anger that puerto rico’s future status has been dragged into the partisan wrestling for control of the senate “we are talking about the human rights of people not a partisan casino chip” de jesús said making it a talking point in the runoffs is selfinterest by both political parties in the us and an underlying mindset that still perpetuates colonial treatment of puerto rico a few georgia officials and activists said they hadn’t heard or seen any ads on puerto rico statehood surrounding the runoffs and were a bit puzzled by the connection of it to socialism rep pedro “pete” marin dduluth one of the first latinos to serve in georgia’s general assembly and a puerto rico native first heard it when asked by a reporter it bothers me to be portrayed like that like pawns said marin who was elected in 2002 it’s kind of a pingpong ball let’s use this as a wedge issue there are more important issues that should be at the forefront as georgians decide who should represent them in the senate marin said “the response to covid that’s the most pressing issue we are facing right now as americans” marin said there are about 97000 puerto ricans in georgia marin said this include families who relocated to the state after hurricane maria struck in 2017 the overall latino population in georgia numbers about 1 million and the largest latino subgroup is people of mexican descent for the record ossoff supports puerto rican statehood and has said puerto ricans should have full rights like any other citizen said miryam lipper ossoffs communications director perdue’s campaign office did not respond to requests for comment but perdue did issue a warning similar to the nrscs about puerto rico statehood happening should democrats win control of the senate cnn reported warnock addressed the republicans messaging in an interview posted online i think that they are trying to divide us again warnock said loefflers campaign did not respond to requests for comment daniel garza president of the centerright organization libre initiative and its political arm said his group is in georgia to turn out latino voters for perdue but he said the group has no plans to mention puerto rico in their efforts garza said he’d push back on the idea that puerto rico statehood is socialism which he said means the government takeover of the means of production and expansion of big government an appeal to white voters republicans aren’t unaware of the bipartisan puerto rican support for statehood and their importance to the party bernard fraga a political science associate professor at emory university in atlanta thinks the warning on statehood is part of republicans broader narrative to motivate white voters in general republicans are warning that if democrats take control of the senate they’ll enact an agenda favored by the left wing of the party and find ways to enhance power fraga said including adding more justices to the supreme court and expanding congress through puerto rico and washington dc “it’s an appeal to moderate and conservative white voters who did not support trump in the general election to bring in those folks and make sure they vote republican in the runoff” fraga said ian haney lópez author of several books on race and politics said that by raising the issue of puerto rico statehood in the context of socialism republicans are “telling a story of people who belong people who are white under threat from people who are dark and taking over as they did during the general election “the deal with socialism is that socialism is a word that connotes something that’s extreme and unamerican” haney lópez said “what is it that’s unamerican in terms of the particular policies that have been advanced by the democrats or even by progressive democrats how are they different for instance from lyndon johnson’s war on poverty or franklin delano roosevelt” when those questions are asked “the whole idea that these are extreme collapses” he said the term socialism used in the case of puerto rico statehood or in other instances becomes a “scare word” haney lópez said “that implies that somebody is extremely nonamerican” follow nbc latino on facebook twitter and instagram', 'https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/11/16/who-will-hold-the-most-power-in-the-next-senate/': 'in conventional wisdom the two georgia senate races are set up to be a titanic struggle between democrats and republicans over which party will control the senate for the first two years of the incoming bidenharris administration the two democrats—jon ossoff and reverend ralph warnock—are arguing that their election is required if the bidenharris campaign promises can become law at least in some form their opponents—current senators kelly loeffler and david perdue—and their surrogates will be warning georgians that their election is all that stands between where the country is now and turning “socialist” the reality of course is very different if both senate candidates win then the senate will be tied 5050 and vice president kamala harris will be able to case the tiebreaking vote—unless one of the democrats fails to vote with the rest of his party this explains why the real potential winner if both ossoff and warnock prevail is someone who up to now hasn’t figured at all into the conversation about these races democratic senator joe manchin of west virginia that’s because as a centrist some would say conservative democrat manchin’s vote is likely to be the deciding one on all of the legislation that the new administration will be asking congress to enact manchin has a history of being an independent thinker certainly not a socialist as governor of his state between 2005 and 2010 manchin defied labeling with a record as a pragmatist cutting taxes raising teacher pay and fixing the state’s broken worker compensation system all the while reducing the state’s debt in the senate amidst growing political polarization manchin has bucked the tide standing as one of few senators still on the lookout for bipartisan compromises to issues through 2018 manchin more frequently voted for rather than against trumpsupported initiatives though he did oppose the 2017 trump tax cut and efforts to repeal or cut back the affordable care act which president biden wants to expand with a public option like biden manchin has come out strongly against efforts to “defund the police” and to progressives’ ire manchin recently has said he would oppose “crazy stuff”—prominently citing as an example any proposals to expand the size of the supreme court to be sure there is a bloc of progressive senators wanting expansive legislation on each of the matters central to the bidenharris legislative agenda pandemicrelated fiscal stimulus climate change infrastructure investment much of it tied to mitigating or adapting to climate change and addressing systemic racism—not just in the criminal justice system but in housing and economic opportunity as well but even if these senators stick together on every detail if any legislation goes too far manchin can block it which brings him back to being the deciding vote on all of the bidenharris legislative agenda if the two georgia democrats win their senate races of course this could all change after the 2022 midterms when the balance of the senate could easily shift again in the direction of either party which would mean that manchin would lose the power he could have for the next two years but those two years will be critical to any legislative success of the incoming administration since it is rare for an administration’s party to gain seats in a midterm election which is the major reason why for most administrations the zenith of their power exists in its first two years there are reasons at least so far that manchin’s potentially pivotal role over the next two years in the senate has not been played up or down at least to date in the georgia senate campaigns democrats eager to get out as many traditional democratic voters as possible may be worried that any spotlight on manchin could depress their base turnout for their part republicans don’t want to acknowledge that a manchintempered senate totally undermines their claims that their opponents would lead to some kind of socialist takeover of the government so don’t expect much to be said about joe manchin in georgia but if the two democrats win you’ll be hearing a lot more about manchin shortly thereafter it is his name that is truly on the georgia senate ballots in january',

'https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/georgia-s-senate-runoffs-show-democrats-need-new-message-socialism-ncna1250075': 'the word socialism has been used for well over a century to sow panic among americans and protect the interests of the very rich by giving a name to what franklin d roosevelt referred to as “fear itself — nameless unreasoning unjustified terror” though herbert hoovers accusations on the eve of the 1932 elections that democrats had “the same philosophy of government which has poisoned all europe they have been the fumes of the witch’s cauldron which boiled in russia” gained little traction then president donald trump and other republicans have had considerable success in spreading similar fears now trumps loss in november hasnt quieted the noise in a recent campaign speech in support of his runoff election sen david perdue rga told georgians that he and the state’s other republican senator kelly loeffler are all that stand between america and “a radical socialist agenda” democrats need an effective counter to the “socialism” canard — preferably before the critical jan 5 georgia senate elections — as well as a way to bring together their progressive and moderate wings but to accomplish both objectives it will take something at which the party has long been notoriously poor messaging democrats should go on offense both by showing americans what republicans mean by socialism and by giving the republicans approach a name that captures what they believe a necessary — though insufficient — starting point will be to make clear to voters that what the republicans are denouncing as socialism is nothing like the current systems in cuba or venezuela or the old systems in the soviet union china and eastern europe exit polls from florida strongly suggest how effective such messaging was there in 2020 rather what republicans decry as socialism is a set of policies that a large majority of americans strongly favor — and from which they already benefit the supposed “socialism” that democrats support includes the military police and fire departments public schools roads the post office social security medicare the affordable care act requiring the wealthy to pay their fair share in taxes combating climate change protecting us all against contaminated foods overseeing essential scientific research and assuring that medications — and vaccines — are safe and effective the last of those are both central to combating the current pandemic and a striking illustration of the absurd lengths to which some republicans are willing to go to fight what they deem socialism for instance in her 2007 screed against the “socialism” of the new deal the forgotten man amity shlaes referred to the food and drug administration as “an outrageous theft of a function normally provided by the private sector — quality control” how would the market deal with food and drugs that kill people after enough people die those left alive would stop buying those products and the companies would have to start making products that leave their consumers alive democrats need an effective counter to the “socialism” canard as well as a way to bring together their progressive and moderate wings democrats should thus go on offense both by showing americans the truth of what republicans mean by socialism and by giving the republicans approach a name that truly captures what they believe they want huge corporations and billionaires to have free rein to accumulate most of the nation’s wealth without concern about how miserably the rest of the population may live — or whether they live at all they are in fact the presentday incarnation of the selfish gilded age men who were called social darwinists — but since even their darwinism is unconcerned with society’s needs lets call them antisocial darwinists most importantly though democrats need to start using a name for their economic approach that is both attractive and emphasizes what it really is — not socialism but capitalism with checks and balances the model for the economic approach that we need can be seen in the political system that the founding fathers created in 1787 though they did not put it in quite the same way the american founders understood the benefits and inherent dangers of democracy in much the same way as winston churchill did when he said in 1947 “no one pretends that democracy is perfect or allwise indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government — except for all those other forms that have been tried” while most of the men who negotiated the us constitution had come to believe that democracy is the “least bad” political system they were very mindful of its inherent flaws including the threat of an unhinged demagogue misleading a large portion of the population accordingly they devised a system based on democracy but with a variety of checks and balances to restrain its tendencies to produce dangerous excesses what republicans now decry as socialism was the essence of the new deal what democrats then need to do is apply to our economic system the wisdom the founders employed in establishing the american political system contrary to what most republicans tell us no one should pretend that unrestrained capitalism is perfect or allwise among economic systems that have been tried capitalism is the “least bad” — and it is essential that we have a basically market system but it is also vital that we have and utilize a set of economic checks and balances — such as regulations and taxation — that will enable us to enjoy the abundance of the market without seeing it concentrated in the hands and financial accounts of a minuscule fraction of our people while the middle class withers and people who are poor are left trapped in poverty the most accurate term for this approach would be “constitutional economics” unfortunately extreme antigovernment economist james m buchanan inappropriately appropriated that name for his radically different program to as nancy maclean accurately put it in “democracy in chains” “save capitalism from democracy—permanently” so to avoid some confusion the democratic economic method could instead be called economic constitutionalism and though the name will be fresh the approach itself is not new no one should pretend that unrestrained capitalism is perfect or allwise after the worship of the unchecked market in the 1920s caused the economy to fall into the great depression roosevelt employed exactly this economic technique to address the crisis indeed in his speech at the commonwealth club in san francisco during his 1932 presidential campaign roosevelt called for “an economic constitutional order” that would provide “a balancing” more than four years later in his second inaugural address in 1937 fdr said “we must find practical controls over blind economic forces and blindly selfish men” and he directly linked the new deal’s efforts to do so with the constitution drawn up in philadelphia 150 years earlier “we have always known that heedless selfinterest was bad morals” roosevelt declared “we know now that it is bad economics” following that principle the new deal saved capitalism by reining in its innate excesses what republicans now decry as socialism was the essence of the new deal economist john kenneth galbraith called it “countervailing power” in his 1952 book american capitalism sen elizabeth warren dmass refers to it today as “capitalism with rules” rather than “socialism the democrats’ approach is in fact simply applying the genius of the american founders to the economy — and the way once again to restore capitalism to good health the prescription for what ails the body economic today parallels the one written for the body politic by those revered patriots who met in philadelphia in 1787 it is applying the political system of james madison and the pragmatic balancing of franklin roosevelt to our current topheavy economy and what could be more american it could even be a part of president joe biden’s inaugural address —but in order to give him an opportunity to put it into effect it ought to be used before then in the georgia senate runoff races', 'https://www.npr.org/2020/11/07/932068951/senate-control-likely-decided-by-fate-of-2-georgia-runoff-races': 'senate

vice president began almost the moment joe biden announced her as his running mate now that harris is vice presidentelect filling her senate seat is not a matter of if but who and when and what are the qualities newsom should consider as he makes his most important political decision yet as governor newsoms considerations include diversity geography electability and political compatibility asked on election day about the possibility of choosing a successor newsom insisted he was not looking forward to it i mean honestly im not even exaggerating theres a hundred chores that id prefer im not kidding newsom joked this is not something that i wish even on my worst enemy because you create enemies in this process you know not just friends and its a vexing decision its a challenging one newsom said harris who was elected to her first senate term in 2016 would be up for reelection in 2022 whoever replaces her will get a couple of years in the senate before running newsom has ruled out a special election to fill out the term diversity is a given said newsoms longtime adviser nathan ballard its not going to be someone who looks like gavin meaning not a straight white male the current moment after george floyds death and harris focus on rooting racial bias out of the criminal justice system would seem to rule out likely senate aspirants such as rep adam schiff at least at this time for newsom there are also other practical considerations is it a caretaker or someone who can turn around a win is it someone thats qualified that may not win but would be newsom asked rhetorically the shortlist kamala harris is the only black woman in the us senate so you can start there would newsom want to replace her with someone who fits that criteria in that case the governor has solid options one bay area mayor fits the bill san franciscos london breed whos won high marks for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic across the bay mayor libby schaaf in oakland who is white also has made a name for herself both democrats have solid relationships with gov newsom and are relatively young rep karen bass from los angeles is chair of the congressional black caucus bass saw her stock rise during the vice presidential vetting process only to be taken down by stories about her past comments regarding cuba and fidel castro but bass 67 is wellliked by house speaker nancy pelosi and others in congress who lobbied bidens vetting committee to choose her to be his running mate and as former speaker of the state assembly bass is known as an effective legislator who worked across party lines house minority leader kevin mccarthy rbakersfield who worked with bass in the legislature called her my favorite democrat which considering thats a short list may not be saying much then theres rep barbara lee a longtime friend of harris and a fellow oaklander who has represented her city in congress since 1998 lee 74 is also close to the bernie sanders wing of the democratic party and was the only member of congress to vote against authorizing the use of force for president george w bush before the iraq war lee also helped bridge the divide between the leftleaning and moderate parts of the party in 2016 after hillary clinton won the nomination that may make her more than acceptable to all parts of the california democratic party silicon valley rep ro khanna 44 is also an up and comer after crushing veteran congressman mike honda in 2016 like harris khanna is indian american and cochaired sanders national campaign for president this year one argument against breed schaaf bass and lee however is that none of them has ever waged a statewide campaign in california which is hardly an easy task given the size of the state and the cost of running secretary of state alex padilla has been widely rumored to covet a us senate seat and is a longtime friend and supporter of newsom padilla chaired newsoms abortive campaign for governor in 2010 before jerry brown jumped in padilla was also an early endorser of newsom while he was running against former los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa and others in 2018 gavin newsom has just a handful of close friends ballard noted and alex is one of them hes part of that inner circle padilla worked as an intern for sen dianne feinstein and at age 26 was elected to the los angeles city council two years later he became the youngest person ever elected president of the city council padilla 47 just oversaw a complicated election where for the first time every registered voter was sent a votebymail ballot but the secretary of state was recently caught up in controversy over a 35 million contract for nonpartisan voter outreach that went to a firm linked with joe biden how much the dustup would matter to newsom is unclear but as ballard tells it padilla is near the top of newsoms list he is eminently qualified for the position and of all the contenders hes the most senatorial ballard said meaning he believes padilla sounds and looks like a senator ballard noted that newsoms choice will be on the ballot in 2022 when the governor is up for reelection its almost like having a running mate he said adding he wouldnt want to appoint someone who would be a drag on his own campaign padilla has run for statewide office twice and won both times another point in padillas favor its a twofor if newsom chooses him or another statewide officeholder he would get to name the replacement for that office as well other options state sen holly mitchell of los angeles would be a dynamic choice to replace harris as chair of the state senate budget committee mitchell has been a fierce and effective advocate for social justice working mothers and lowincome people but mitchell 56 was just elected to the powerful los angeles county board of supervisors and would seem unlikely to give that up before shes even sworn in newsom who said hes been inundated with subtle and notsosubtle entreaties by wouldbe appointees called the decision vexing because of all the dynamics involved in this case youve got people that voted for kamala harris and so is it someone in her image do you sort of extend that narrative newsom wondered aloud newsom whose recent nomination of a black openly gay judge to the california supreme court seems to enjoy making history in that case he has several options including toni atkins president pro tempore of the state senate is a 58yearold san diego democrat who was also speaker of the state assembly and is a lesbian and a longtime ally of newsom long beach mayor robert garcia 42 is latino peruvian american and the citys first openly gay mayor he lost both his parents to covid19 and has a compelling personal story others who are either thought to be eyeing this us senate seat

be a possible member of bidens cabinet although he recently said its more likely than not that hed finish his term which expires in 2022 rep adam schiff of los angeles has been omnipresent on media as

about returning to washington he said he prefers to live in sacramento while newsom eyes these potential picks for political ascension he has also long eyed higher office he is widely believed to have seen himself running for president one day though that option seemingly foreclosed at the moment by the ascension of harris but the former san francisco mayor has remained quite popular with voters receiving a 57 approval rating in an october survey from the public policy institute of california he could decide to run for the us senate when feinstein leaves in any case newsom said on election

far the senate has fallen is the dearth of amendments considered on the floor which is devoted mainly to judicial confirmation votes senators used to fight it out over their bills now with senators

to propose or debate changes ever the tennessean mr alexander compared it to “joining the grand ole opry and not being allowed to sing” but he said the problem was not with the rules it is with senators who reflexively block their colleagues from bringing up amendments effectively shutting down the senate what is needed he said was a change in behavior by senators who must learn to show the “restraint” necessary to allow debate and the political courage to vote no when they oppose something — rather than stifle it outright but mr udall was having none of the idea that a behavioral adjustment was all that was necessary “i don’t buy the statement that the rules are fine that we just need to change the people or we need the people to change themselves or we just need to get better

realities hell face when he takes office in january with a possibly divided congress republican lawmakers could present roadblocks to bidens top priorities including his cabinet nominees and legislative agenda the majority of senate republicans have yet to publicly acknowledge bidens victory including majority leader mitch mcconnell biden has blamed their hesitance to recognize his win on intimidation from president donald trump and has expressed his belief that gop lawmakers will cooperate down the road including on a covid19 relief package im hoping that the reason why my friends on the other side have not stepped up to do something is because of their fear of retribution from the president biden said wednesday during a virtual roundtable with frontline health care workers and

navigated treacherous airspace and commanded a space shuttle as a retired navy combat pilot and nasa astronaut kelly is used to hazardous journeys but his training didn’t prepare him for navigating the complex corridors cloakrooms and centuriesold traditions of the us senate when he traveled to capitol hill to see the chamber where he will serve for the first time there kelly entered the intimate chamber along with other incoming senators for an upclose look at the space he will occupy to represent arizona with his win over sen martha mcsally rariz he will join sen kyrsten sinema dariz and arizonans will be represented by a pair of democrats for the first time in 67 years before getting lost in the maze of buildings and hallways kelly sat in the desk of sen ben cardin dmaryland along with seven members of the freshmen class as he heard from the senate staffers about the rules and traditions of the senate “i will say after 21 months of campaigning — campaigns are about reaching out to folks in places where they live and work throughout arizona — it’s sort of abstract” he told the arizona republic on friday “and then within a week i find myself sitting there on the senate floor and that’s when it becomes just very very real that the election is over and now it’s time to get to work” kelly ousted mcsally in arizona’s special senate election and will serve the remainder of the term initially won in 2016 by the late sen john mccain rariz who died two years later kelly hopes to work at the desk once used by mccain and before him the late former sen barry goldwater rariz kelly said he spoke to mccain’s widow cindy mccain about working from that desk in his eventual senate office the history that desk holds — and the seat he will soon occupy — is meaningful to him “i mean this is john mccain and somebody that i looked up to when i was a 22yearold pilot in flight school” kelly said “he was the example of how you serve your country under the most challenging circumstances he was a hero of mine when i was young and we often don’t get to meet our heroes it’s also much less often that you eventually get to call them a friend and to be elected to his united states senate seat that — that’s a very big deal for me” mcsally who was eventually appointed by gov doug ducey to the seat called kelly to concede friday her call came nine days after the associated press called the race for kelly the winner and days after it had become apparent that despite ongoing votecounting she would not pull off a surprise comefrombehind victory kelly was on the other line when her call from a tucsonbased area code came through he dialed the number back mcsally was on the other end of the line they spoke for five to 10 minutes he said “it was a good call” he said “really very nice and positive and we were talking about how we can best work together here over the next three to four weeks” kelly said mcsally understood that he and his transition team were working on an accelerated timeline and that he would be sworn into office before the new group of elected senators and wanted to help make the transition as soon as possible kelly is eligible to take the oath of office as soon as arizona certifies its election results which is scheduled for nov 30 he expects to take office in early december asked if he was surprised that it took mcsally so long to concede kelly downplayed the weight of the tradition “well i mean this concession thing is i mean its not like a formal part of the process” he said “i think its important that people when theyre going to make this call they do it on their own … that it occurred over a week you know 10 days after the election that’s fine with me” kelly also heard from ducey on friday afternoon kelly began transitioning to the senate last week after assembling a team he considers representative of the state’s demographics and the issues he wants to confront first that team is also helping him make staffing decisions for his offices in washington dc and back home in arizona the team is helping come up with suggestions for the committees he is interested in serving on he wants his experience as an engineer veteran astronaut and gunsafety activist to guide his work in the chamber those suggestions will be put forward to senate leadership in the coming weeks he said “the requests that we make will ultimately be focused on arizona but also focused on my own personal experiences” he said the powerful senate armed services committee is high on his list when he died mccain chaired that committee goldwater was armed services chairman in the 1980s mcsally served on it during her tenure in the chamber kelly’s immediate focus is on advocating for a financial stimulus package to help families small businesses local governments health care workers and tribal communities reeling from the covid19 pandemic throughout his campaign kelly called on a gridlocked congress to pass additional relief he said it is unacceptable for congress to kick the issue to next year “weve got hundreds of thousands of individuals who have families that are trying to get by on 240 a week of unemployment benefits — that doesnt work kelly said … that’s just not the way our government should function to say ‘this can wait’ it can’t wait” president donald trump’s administration the democraticcontrolled house of representatives and the gopcontrolled senate should pass a bill to deliver relief as soon as possible he said kelly will have a vote on the government’s next spending package and perhaps on judicial nominees though he’s just days out from his own election win kelly already has jumped into the fray for others he is splitting campaign donations to help the democratic candidates in georgia’s two runoff races those contests will determine which party controls the us senate and are crucial to advancing democratic presidentelect joe biden’s policy agenda “they’re going to be very competitive both of them and i think the outcome is uncertain” kelly said it’s also unclear how kelly will navigate the state’s electoral crosscurrents his win along with biden’s heartened arizona democrats at the same time voters kept the state’s legislature in gop control and republicans beat back efforts to take another congressional seat for his part kelly sees opportunity “i don’t think that partisanship in either side is good” he said “i like to see elections that are somewhat close i always thought our election would be close i’ve got to convince republicans and independents and democrats to vote for me to be successful … im going to represent every single arizonan to the best of my ability into the united states senate regardless of whether or not they voted

but it doesn’t feel the same this time” said moskowitz about the drop in passion among younger voters in georgia though moskowitz says his fraternity has made an effort to make sure people are registered to vote there has definitely been fewer social media posts and less engagement in the weeks leading up to the runoff compared to what he saw in the general election he attributes this partly due to the vitriol that many young voters felt towards trump specifically about the drastic changes that the pandemic has brought combined with the fact that special elections tend to have lower turnout moskowitz thinks that many young people see this election as less consequential reaching young people is a major area of focus for the ga action team which is trying to make sure all newly eligible voters are registered before the dec 7 deadline “23000 people will turn 18 by january 5 and become eligible to vote in the runoff” said posner phone bankers have been focused on trying

fivealarm fire i’d like to lay a few things out for you things just to consider things that maybe you’ll carry with you in the future and then i have a question for you let’s begin here you won last tuesday convincingly no two ways about it the republican candidates in this state mostly crushed their democratic competition a few statehouse races in dem strongholds notwithstanding in the allimportant statewide race at the top of this state’s ticket — sen doug jones vs republican tommy tuberville — there was a convincing tuberville win so congratulations but let me ask you this what did you win not “what did the party win” but what did you win personally these elections aren’t about the team winning they’re about public representation that best reflects your interests and values advertisement that’s what a representative government is about right electing people who will go to dc or montgomery or your local courthouse and get the things done that are important to you so did you get that well let’s take a look according to a 2018 public affairs research council study completed in alabama these were the top five issues for state voters 1 public education 2 healthcare 3 government corruption and ethics 4 mental health and substance abuse and 5 poverty public service announcement obviously a few things have happened since then so i think it’s safe to say we can include the economy and global health crises in the top seven and i also know from the campaign ads and constant comments on social media sites that replacing justices on the supreme court mostly in an effort to overturn the legalization of abortion is high on the list in fact it was most often the single topic listed by voters and the single reason many said they were voting against jones so there’s your list of important issues did your elected officials have a plan to address any of those things in short no i checked and you can too go to the websites for tuberville robert aderholt mo brooks mike rogers barry moore and jerry carl — those are the us senator and representatives elected in alabama last week — and see if you can locate their specific plans for any of those things hell half of them don’t even list education — your no 1 priority — on their websites on your no 2 issue healthcare the responses are so laughably stupid it’s frankly hard to believe that adults wrote them every single one of them wants to “repeal and replace obamacare” none of them specify exactly what they plan to replace it with let me put that another way they want to take healthcare away from hundreds of thousands of alabamians in the middle of a pandemic and just hope that insurance companies and hospitals behave appropriately and don’t mistreat anyone let’s be real here these guys got elected because they’re on the r team and because you’ve been led to believe that the most important vote that can be cast is one for the people who will choose our next supreme court justice and you believe that because you have the misguided notion that the supreme court will one day overturn roe v wade and ban abortions which will magically eliminate all abortions you also believe the high court will do other things like repeal obamacare or overturn precedent allowing gay marriage bad news none of those things are going to happen just this week the court despite a 63 conservative majority sent strong signals that the latest attempt to kill obamacare will be unsuccessful in june the court upheld an opinion that blocked a louisiana law requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals before they can perform an abortion the law was designed to limit abortion clinics in the state in october the court declined to even hear the case of a former kentucky clerk who was jailed for failing to issue marriage licenses to samesex couples now we could get into the technical legal reasons behind those decisions but they all essentially boil down to this the rulings in the major cases on abortion obamacare and gay marriage weren’t made flippantly and once they were made they became precedent for the court and incredibly hard to overturn but don’t take my word for it go read the opinions in the cases i mentioned read the analysis from legal scholars read the words of the justices and when you finish ask yourself this if these conservative judges are going to behave like responsible judges then what exactly am i getting out of all these republican votes our schools are in bad shape our health care system is failing we’re going to have to open a new prison just for convicted republican lawmakers and elected officials at the rate we’re going we’re at the top of the charts on poverty and we have one of the highest death rates in the world for covid what else do we need to fail at before you’ll consider voting for someone who has some idea what they plan to do no really i’m asking',

states november election and casting doubt on its voting system without evidence the possible effect of the mixed messaging on republican turnout in january is worrying some of georgias conservatives the states republican election officials have repeatedly asserted theres been no evidence of widespread fraud but incumbent republican sens david perdue and kelly loeffler have called on republican secretary of state brad raffensperger to resign without evidence of wrongdoing president trump has also criticized raffensperger and called out republican gov brian kemp who received trumps endorsement in 2018 we could be handing senate minority leader chuck schumer control of the senate by the republican disarray conservative talk show host erick erickson said last week on wsb radio its a little bit frustrating to see the republicans squabbling with each other over this when frankly theres no sign that the election was stolen in georgia trump tried to counter these concerns on friday tweeting that though the november election was a total scam we must get out and help david and kelly two great people otherwise we are playing right into the hands of some very sick people donald trump jr has also called the suggestion of skipping the january runoffs nonsense kemp echoed criticism of the election system while formally certifying the results last week awarding presidentelect joe biden the states 16 electoral college votes ive heard directly from countless georgians they expect better and they deserve better kemp said of several thousand uncounted ballots discovered during an audit the states election officials have said the audits margin of error was within the expected error rate of handcounting ballots we are going to suppress our own vote still republicans including vice president pence who campaigned in georgia on nov 20 are urging supporters to trust the system again in january vote georgia vote to reelect david perdue and kelly loeffler to the united states senate he called out to hundreds gathered at an outdoor rally in canton ga youre seeing many republicans now speaking out and saying if we undermine faith in our election system if we tell people that perhaps their votes didnt count we are going to suppress our own vote said brian robinson a georgia republican strategist typically you can expect democrats to take potshots at republicans but when republicans take them at each other its not helpful raffensperger said in an npr interview im sure democrats have just gone out and bought a box of popcorn and are enjoying the show we need to really unify as republicans and make sure that we help our senators get across a protrump georgia lawyer lin wood who tried unsuccessfully to stop the states election certification vowed not to vote in the runoffs if the unlawful november election isnt addressed he is requesting a special session to change election law an idea that kemp lt gov geoff duncan and georgia house speaker david ralston have rejected because it would result in endless litigation while still a fringe position a political committee associated with onetime trump adviser roger stone urged voters to punish the gop by writing in the presidents name on the runoff ballots with enough writeins in the georgia senate race we can tilt the balance in georgia in trumps favor the groups website said if we can do this we have a real chance at getting these rino senators to act on the illegitimate and corrupt election presided over by a democrat party that is invested in the communist takeover of our great nation writing in candidates is not allowed in the upcoming races because theyre runoffs between the top two candidates from the nov 3 election voters such as kristen jones who attended the canton rally headlined by pence have questions about the system going into january how can you have an election after it was completely fraudulent i mean that should be every georgians question right now she said jones said she will still vote again but she knows someone who has pledged never to do so after the november election that just made me so terribly sad she said gop advantages republicans have advantages going into these elections historically theyve always won runoffs in georgia and republicans in both senate races earned more votes than democrats in november even as biden carried the top of the ticket plus robinson argued republicans have the upper hand in terms of motivation while democrats have accomplished their goal of defeating trump republicans still have a lot on the line democrats are polishing their trophy and beginning to settle in for a long winters nap now he said its going to be much harder to energize democrats with a scary message motivate them with fear its very easy to motivate republican voters with fear because republican voters are terrified of whats coming down the pike if biden house speaker nancy pelosi and schumer control all the levers of power in washington but the big unknown is what kind of damage the election integrity questions will do to republican turnout we dont know how voters are going to respond to this robinson said we just dont know with the runoffs the margins are going to be close and so you need to get every single voter back out and i dont think this is the way to do it democratic state sen jen jordan said of the republicans election questions she said the democrats past history of losing runoffs in georgia doesnt apply because the level of resources and excitement is unprecedented plus she said democrats have an x factor this time around hope because biden narrowly won the state that light at the end of the tunnel is really going to push a lot of democrats who may would normally say well why does it matter she said they know that it absolutely does and they could be the one vote that pushes it over after a hand recount of the ballots trumps campaign asked for a machine recount of those same ballots which is currently underway its the third time in less than a month that georgias presidential ballots have been tallied',

second term but the north dakota republican said he has no interest in leveraging his current office for any legislative jobs such as one in the us senate while some political observers speculated the governor and former tech executive could one day jump for a coveted senate seat as sen john hoeven did in 2010 burgums dismissal of the idea leaves some question marks about the future of the two congressional offices over the next decade i dont have any political aspirations other than being governor of north dakota burgum said in a meeting with forum editors and reporters on thursday dec 3 ive never viewed this as a stepping stone to any place else i have never been interested in a legislative job because this is an operations role lt gov brent sanford and i are both business guys the governors spokesman mike nowatzki confirmed to the forum on friday that burgum is not interested in pursuing positions in the us senate down the line the statement of intent from burgum may mean hoeven and sen kevin cramer are safe in their current spots but it could also leave an opening for rising stars on the national political stage both senators are wellliked by north dakotans and relatively young but their own political calculations could change depending on the moves of other republicans over the next few years listen live watch live a spokesperson for hoevens campaign said the senior senator does intend to run for reelection when his second term ends in 2022 mike jacobs a grand forks herald columnist and longtime north dakota political observer said hoeven could likely hold his senate seat for life if he wanted to but cramers 2024 bid could bring more intrigue unlike hoeven jacobs argued that cramer is vulnerable to a primary challenge one legislative arena where burgum could get involved given the right republican opponent jacobs speculated the governor might throw his weight against cramers reelection cramers affiliation with the far rightwing of the north dakota republican party likely makes burgum nervous jacobs said the junior senator has close ties with the small but influential rightwing bastiat caucus of the north dakota legislature a faction that jacobs suggested burgum does not want elevated if the right republican challenger comes along in 2024 it would be very interesting to see where burgum put his money jacobs said i can envision doug burgum being the agent of cramers downfall rob port a conservative columnist for the forum was unsurprised about burgums dismissal of the senate jobs and said he is less inclined to predict any turnover in the top north dakota political offices for the foreseeable future i dont see the political winds shifting that much in north dakota he said port guessed burgum likely knows he doesnt have the right temperament for a legislative job and predicted the likeliest next step for the republican governor would be a third term in 2024 while port acknowledged cramers outspoken tendencies put him at more risk of losing his senate seat than hoeven he also argued both probably can have those seats for as long as they want them in the event that north dakotas political landscape sees a shakeup in the next few election cycles jacobs said he will be on the lookout for a few prominent republican women to move into the spotlight kirsten baesler the state superintendent of public instruction could be well positioned for a bigger profile in a few years fargo senator shannon roers jones the most ambitious republican legislator would make for a formidable statewide candidate according to jacobs if anyone is going to get burgums backing over cramer in 2024 it could be her jacobs said in the meantime burgum said he only has eyes for his current gig he didnt rule out running for a third term alongside his lieutenant governor when this one ends im not a politician but they tell me if i answer no then immediately i have four years of being a lame duck he joked on thursday in response to a question about his aspirations for another term so we should probably tell you that brent and i want to do this for the rest of our lives thats probably the right answer readers can reach forum

blocks ap photoseth wenig washington ap — control of the senate likely won’t be decided until a january runoff in georgia even after democrat joe biden won the white house on saturday that postelection cliffhanger will determine the balance of power in washington as neither party appears to have a lock on a senate majority right now so far the tally for the next senate is 48 republicans and 48 democrats after tuesday’s election two seats in georgia are headed to runoffs on jan 5 and seats in north carolina and alaska are still too early to call advertisement the stakes are high for for a momentous political struggle in georgia during president donald trump’s final lameduck days in office the state is closely divided with democrats making gains on republicans fueled by a surge of new voters but no democrat has been elected senator in some 20 years as much as 500 million could be spent on the two races one strategist said “now we take georgia and then we change america” senate democratic leader chuck schumer told a crowd celebrating biden’s victory saturday on the streets of brooklyn with a democratic majority in the senate the party that also controls the house would have a firm grasp on power in washington biden would have latitude over nominees including for his cabinet and a chance to push major portions of his legislative agenda through congress if democrats fall short senate majority leader mitch mcconnell a kentucky republican could wield the power to check biden’s ambitions “the senate is the last line of defense” tweeted the national republican senatorial committee as soon as the presidential race was called for biden it was a fundraising appeal republicans have been working to retain their majority but even if they secure the final two races where ballots are still being counted in north carolina and alaska they would still fall short of the 51 seats needed in north carolina sen thom tillis is trying to fend off democratic challenger cal cunningham in a tight race that is too early to call alaska gop sen dan sullivan is favored for another term against al gross an independent running as a democrat the political math problem for republicans is that the vice president of the party holding the white house casts the tiebreaking vote in the senate next year that would be vice presidentelect kamala harris that means 50 seats for democrats would result in control over the chamber but republicans would need 51 seats to cement their hold on power advertisement that would put georgia center stage as many expect is about to happen both senate seats in the state are now held by republican incumbents they were forced into the january runoff contests after no candidate reached the 50 threshold needed to win outright in multicandidate races gop sen kelly loeffler will face rafael warnock a black pastor from the church where rev martin luther king jr preached and republican sen david perdue a top trump ally will face democratic challenger jon ossoff “now more than ever we need to keep the senate in republican hands” tweeted loeffler she said saturday that she and perdue are “the last line of defense against the radical left” ossoff’s campaign aired a new ad detailing a “path to recovery” from the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout he calls for following the advice of medical experts to deal with the virus and a massive infrastructure plan to create jobs “we need leaders who bring us together to get this done” ossoff says in the ad biden had been mum on the senate balance as he awaited the results in his own election but he offered a preview before tuesday’s election “i can’t tell you how important it is that we flip the united states senate there’s no state more consequential than georgia in that fight” biden declared at an atlanta rally on oct 27 when he campaigned alongside ossoff and warnock republicans agree “it’s all on the line in georgia” said steven law the president of senate leadership fund the outside group aligned with mcconnell that spent big trying keep senate control house speaker nancy pelosi reminded her colleagues of the stakes for the entire party during the lameduck sprint ahead “how we conduct it in the next two months will affect how we do in georgia” pelosi told house democrats according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the private caucus
